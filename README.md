### A coder's Bible

## Presu
* Open-Source Bible Translation


## Goals
* Augment Bible study through clarity and consistency of meaning
* Normalize word translations and leave the interpretation to the student
* Use transliterals where is makes sense- Christians already have a vernacular...lets use it
* Leverage version control tech to give both dependability and visibility to the process
* Simple, easily parsable structure avoiding tradition baggage


## Process

Original language words that are loanable are transliterated.
* Hebrew transliteration is done via a revised Michigan/Claremont mapping that is more ASCII friendly
* Greek transliteration is done via the mapping below.
- e.g. Yahweh; well-known enough to understandable as the name God gives Hisself
- e.g. Shalom; recognizable enough to have meaning on its own
Preserve the original spellings as much as possible.
Try not to use the same English word for multiple original.


## Transliteration

In the interest of making a highly readable translation: transliterated words are are as clean as possible while preserving the original spelling.
In general we go letter-for-letter except where there is none, then its pairs of letters.
