Presu:
* Open-Source Bible Translation
* Initially based on YLT
* Citations via "OPEN"

Goals:
* Simple, easily parsable structure (devoid of tradition baggage)
* Transliterate words commonly used in Bible-nerd vernacular (e.g. Yahweh, Shalom)
* Normalize word translations whose meaning is obfuscated by disparate translation (e.g. "Holy Ones" vs. Saints, firstfruits vs. myriad first___)
* Leverage version control tech to give both dependability and visibility to the process.
* Simple, easily parsable structure (devoid of tradition baggage)
* Transliterate words common in Bible-nerd vernacular
* Unify words whose meaning is obfuscated by disparate translation (i.e. undo the obscurity of certain English words/phrases).
