### A coder's Bible

## Presu
* Open-Source Bible Translation
* Initially based on YLT


## Goals
* Augment Bible study through clarity and consistency of meaning
* Normalize word translations whose meaning is obfuscated by disparate translation (e.g. "Holy Ones" vs. Saints, firstfruits vs. myriad first___)
* Undo the obscurity of certain English words/phrases
* Leverage version control tech to give both dependability and visibility to the process
* Simple, easily parsable structure avoiding tradition baggage


## Process

Original language words that are loanable are transliterated.
Other original language words are translated into a single English word, with appropriate conjugation, throughout.
When the same English word has been used for different original language words this is undone to use different words.
