### A coder's Bible

Presu:
* Open-Source Bible Translation
* Initially based on YLT
* Citations via "OPEN"


Goals:
* Augment Bible study through clarity and consistency of meaning
* Normalize word translations whose meaning is obfuscated by disparate translation (e.g. "Holy Ones" vs. Saints, firstfruits vs. myriad first___)
* Undo the obscurity of certain English words/phrases
* Leverage version control tech to give both dependability and visibility to the process
* Simple, easily parsable structure (devoid of tradition baggage)


Examples:
