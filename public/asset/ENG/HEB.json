    "undefined And those of the sons of Levi who receive the priestly office have authorization according to the law to collect a tithe from the people, that is, from their fellow countrymen, although they too are descend-ants of Abraham. ",
    "undefined But Melchizedek who does not share their ancestry collected a tithe from Abraham and blessed the one who pos-sessed the promise. ",
    "undefined Now without dispute the inferior is blessed by the superior, ",
    "undefined and in one case tithes are received by mortal men, while in the other by him who is affirmed to be alive. ",

    "undefined For when the priesthood changes, a change in the law must come as well. ",
    "undefined Yet the one these things are spoken about belongs to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever officiated at the altar. ",
    "undefined For it is clear that our Lord is descended from Judah, yet Moses said nothing about priests in connection with that tribe. ",
    "undefined And this is even clearer if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchiz-edek, ",
    "undefined who has become a priest not by a legal regulation about physical descent but by the power of an indestructible life. ",
    "undefined For here is the testimony about him: “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.” ",
    "undefined On the one hand a former command is set aside because it is weak and useless, ",
    "undefined for the law made nothing perfect. On the other hand a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God. ",
    "undefined And since this was not done without a sworn affirmation – for the others have become priests without a sworn affirmation, ",
