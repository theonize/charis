    "undefined For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I was savagely perse-cuting the church of God and trying to destroy it. ",
    "undefined I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my nation, and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors. ",

    "undefined Now this matter arose because of the false brothers with false pretenses who slipped in unnoticed to spy on our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, to make us slaves. ",

    "undefined Brothers and sisters, I offer an exam-ple from everyday life: When a covenant has been ratified, even though it is only a human contract, no one can set it aside or add any-thing to it. ",
    "undefined Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. Scripture does not say, “and to the descendants,” refer-ring to many, but “and to your descendant,” referring to one, who is Christ. ",
    "undefined What I am saying is this: The law that came four hundred thirty years later does not cancel a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to invalidate the promise. ",
    "undefined For if the inheritance is based on the law, it is no longer based on the prom-ise, but God graciously gave it to Abraham through the promise.",
    "undefined Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions, until the arri-val of the descendant to whom the promise had been made. It was administered through angels by an intermediary. ",
    "undefined Now an inter-mediary is not for one party alone, but God is one. ",
    "undefined Is the law therefore opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law. ",
    "undefined But the scripture imprisoned eve-rything and everyone under sin so that the promise could be given – because of the faith-fulness of Jesus Christ – to those who believe.Sons of God Are Heirs of Promise",

    "undefined But one, the son by the slave woman, was born by natural descent, while the other, the son by the free woman, was born through the promise. ",
    "undefined These things may be treated as an allegory, for these women repre-sent two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai bearing children for slavery; this is Hagar. ",

    "undefined But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. ",
