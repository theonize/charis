    " The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. ",
    "undefined As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, “Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,who will prepare your way,",
    "undefined the voice of one shouting in the wilderness,‘Prepare the way for the Lord,make his paths straight.’”",
    "undefined In the wilderness John the baptizer be-gan preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. ",
    "undefined People from the whole Judean countryside and all of Jerusalem were going out to him, and he was baptizing them in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins. ",
    "undefined John wore a garment made of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. ",
    "undefined He proclaimed, “One more powerful than I am is coming after me; I am not worthy to bend down and untie the strap of his sandals. ",
    "undefined I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus",
    "undefined Now in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River. ",
    "undefined And just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw the heav-ens splitting apart and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. ",
    "undefined And a voice came from heaven: “You are my one dear Son; in you I take great delight.” ",
    "undefined The Spirit immediate-ly drove him into the wilderness. ",
    "undefined He was in the wilderness forty days, enduring tempta-tions from Satan. He was with wild animals, and angels were ministering to his needs.Preaching in Galilee and the Call of the Disciples",
    "undefined Now after John was imprisoned, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God. ",
    "undefined He said, “The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and be-lieve the gospel!” ",
    "undefined As he went along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen). ",
    "undefined Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will turn you into fishers of people.” ",
    "undefined They left their nets immediately and followed him. ",
    "undefined Going on a little far-ther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother in their boat mending nets. ",
    "undefined Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.Jesus’ Authority",
    "undefined Then they went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the syna-gogue and began to teach. ",
    "undefined The people there were amazed by his teaching, because he taught them like one who had authority, not like the experts in the law. ",
    "undefined Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, ",
    "undefined “Leave us alone, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are – the Holy One of God!” ",
    "undefined But Jesus rebuked him: “Silence! Come out of him!” ",
    "undefined After throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him. ",
    "undefined They were all amazed so that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him.” ",
    "undefined So the news about him spread quickly throughout all the region around Galilee.Healings at Simon’s House ",
    "undefined Now as soon as they left the syna-gogue, they entered Simon and Andrew’s house, with James and John. ",
    "undefined Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down, sick with a fever, so they spoke to Jesus at once about her. ",
    "undefined He came and raised her up by gently tak-ing her hand. Then the fever left her and she began to serve them. ",
    "undefined When it was even-ing, after sunset, they brought to him all who were sick and demon-possessed. ",
    "undefined The whole town gathered by the door. ",
    "undefined So he healed many who were sick with various dis-eases and drove out many demons. But he would not permit the demons to speak, be-cause they knew him.Praying and Preaching ",
    "undefined Then Jesus got up early in the morning when it was still very dark, departed, and went out to a deserted place, and there he spent time in prayer. ",
    "undefined Simon and his com-panions searched for him. ",
    "undefined When they found him, they said, “Everyone is looking for you.” ",
    "undefined He replied, “Let us go elsewhere, into the surrounding villages, so that I can preach there too. For that is what I came out here to do.” ",
    "undefined So he went into all of Galilee preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.Cleansing a Leper",
    "undefined Now a leper came to him and fell to his knees, asking for help. “If you are willing, you can make me clean,” he said. ",
    "undefined Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be clean!” ",
    "undefined The leprosy left him at once, and he was clean. ",
    "undefined Immediately Jesus sent the man away with a very strong warning. ",
    "undefined He told him, “See that you do not say anything to anyone, but go, show yourself to a priest, and bring the offering that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.” ",
    "undefined But as the man went out he began to announce it publicly and spread the story widely, so that Jesus was no longer able to enter any town openly but stayed outside in remote places. \tStill they kept coming to him from every-where.Healing and Forgiving a Paralytic "
  ],
  [
    " Now after some days, when he re-turned to Capernaum, the news spread that he was at home. ",
    "undefined So many gathered that there was no longer any room, not even by the door, and he preached the word to them. ",
    "undefined Some people came bringing to him a paralytic, car-ried by four of them. ",
    "undefined When they were not able to bring him in because of the crowd, they removed the roof above Jesus. Then, after tearing it out, they lowered the stretcher the paralytic was lying on. ",
    "undefined When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” ",
    "undefined Now some of the ex-perts in the law were sitting there, turning these things over in their minds: ",
    "undefined “Why does this man speak this way? He is blasphem-ing! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” ",
    "undefined Now immediately, when Jesus realized in his spirit that they were contemplating such thoughts, he said to them, “Why are you think-ing such things in your hearts? ",
    "undefined Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up, take your stretcher, and walk’? ",
    "undefined But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” – he said to the paralytic – ",
    "undefined “I tell you, stand up, take your stretcher, and go home.” ",
    "undefined And immediately the man stood up, took his stretcher, and went out in front of them all. They were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”The Call of Levi; Eating with Sinners ",
    "undefined Jesus went out again by the sea. The whole crowd came to him, and he taught them. ",
    "undefined As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax booth. “Fol-low me,” he said to him. And he got up and followed him. ",
    "undefined As Jesus was having a meal in Levi’s home, many tax collectors and sin-ners were eating with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. ",
    "undefined When the experts in the law and the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?” ",
    "undefined When Jesus heard this he said to them, “Those who are healthy don’t need a physi-cian, but those who are sick do. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”The Superiority of the New ",
    "undefined Now John’s disciples and the Phari-sees were fasting. So they came to Jesus and said, “Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disci-ples don’t fast?” ",
    "undefined Jesus said to them, “The wedding guests cannot fast while the bride-groom is with them, can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they do not fast. ",
    "undefined But the days are coming when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and at that time they will fast. ",
    "undefined No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise, the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and the tear becomes worse. ",
    "undefined And no one pours new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be destroyed. Instead new wine is poured into new wineskins.”Lord of the Sabbath ",
    "undefined Jesus was going through the grain fields on a Sabbath, and his disciples began to pick some heads of wheat as they made their way. ",
    "undefined So the Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is against the law on the Sabbath?” ",
    "undefined He said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions were hun-gry – ",
    "undefined how he entered the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the sacred bread, which is against the law for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to his companions?” ",
    "undefined Then he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for people, not people for the Sabbath. ",
    "undefined For this reason the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”Healing a Withered Hand "
  ],
  [
    " Then Jesus entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a with-ered hand. ",
    "undefined They watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they could accuse him. ",
    "undefined So he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Stand up among all these people.” ",
    "undefined Then he said to them, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or evil, to save a life or destroy it?” But they were silent. ",
    "undefined After looking around at them in anger, grieved by the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. ",
    "undefined So the Pharisees went out imme-diately and began plotting with the Herodians, as to how they could assassinate him.Crowds by the Sea ",
    "undefined Then Jesus went away with his disci-ples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him. And from Judea, ",
    "undefined Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan River, and around Tyre and Sidon a great multitude came to him when they heard about the things he had done. ",
    "undefined Because of the crowd, he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him so the crowd would not press toward him. ",
    "undefined For he had healed many, so that all who were afflicted with diseases pressed toward him in order to touch him. ",
    "undefined And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.” ",
    "undefined But he sternly ordered them not to make him known.Appointing the Twelve Apostles ",
    "undefined Now Jesus went up the mountain and called for those he wanted, and they came to him. ",
    "undefined He appointed twelve (whom he named apostles), so that they would be with him and he could send them to preach ",
    "undefined and to have authority to cast out demons. ",
    "undefined He appointed twelve: To Simon he gave the name Peter; ",
    "undefined to James and his brother John, the sons of Zebedee, he gave the name Boanerges (that is, “sons of thunder”); ",
    "undefined and Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddae-us, Simon the Zealot, ",
    "undefined and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.Jesus and Beelzebul",
    "undefined Now Jesus went home, and a crowd gathered so that they were not able to eat. ",
    "undefined When his family heard this they went out to restrain him, for they said, “He is out of his mind.” ",
    "undefined The experts in the law who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and, “By the ruler of demons he casts out demons.” ",
    "undefined So he called them and spoke to them in parables: “How can Sa-tan cast out Satan? ",
    "undefined If a kingdom is divid-ed against itself, that kingdom will not be able to stand. ",
    "undefined If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. ",
    "undefined And if Satan rises against himself and is di-vided, he is not able to stand and his end has come. ",
    "undefined But no one is able to enter a strong man’s house and steal his property unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can thor-oughly plunder his house. ",
    "undefined I tell you the truth, people will be forgiven for all sins, even all the blasphemies they utter. ",
    "undefined But who-ever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, but is guilty of an eternal sin” ",
    "undefined (because they said, “He has an un-clean spirit”).Jesus’ True Family ",
    "undefined Then Jesus’ mother and his brothers came. Standing outside, they sent word to him, to summon him. ",
    "undefined A crowd was sitting around him and they said to him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.” ",
    "undefined He answered them and said, “Who are my mother and my brothers?” ",
    "undefined And looking at those who were sitting around him in a circle, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! ",
    "undefined For whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and moth-er.”The Parable of the Sower "
  ],
  [
    " Again he began to teach by the lake. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the lake and sat there while the whole crowd was on the shore by the lake. ",
    "undefined He taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching said to them: ",
    "undefined “Listen! A sower went out to sow. ",
    "undefined And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. ",
    "undefined Other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep. ",
    "undefined When the sun came up it was scorched, and because it did not have sufficient root, it withered. ",
    "undefined Other seed fell among the thorns, and they grew up and choked it, and it did not produce grain. ",
    "undefined But other seed fell on good soil and produced grain, sprouting and growing; some yielded thirty times as much, some sixty, and some a hundred times.” ",
    "undefined And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear had better listen!”The Purpose of Parables ",
    "undefined When he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. ",
    "undefined He said to them, “The secret of the king-dom of God has been given to you. But to those outside, everything is in parables,",
    "undefined so that although they look they may look but not see,and although they hear they may hear but not understand,so they may not repent and be forgiven.”",
    "undefined He said to them, “Don’t you under-stand this parable? Then how will you under-stand any parable? ",
    "undefined The sower sows the word. ",
    "undefined These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: Whenever they hear, immediately Satan comes and snatches the word that was sown in them. ",
    "undefined These are the ones sown on rocky ground: As soon as they hear the word, they receive it with joy. ",
    "undefined But they have no root in themselves and do not endure. Then, when trouble or persecu-tion comes because of the word, immediately they fall away. ",
    "undefined Others are the ones sown among thorns: They are those who hear the word, ",
    "undefined but worldly cares, the seductive-ness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it produces nothing. ",
    "undefined But these are the ones sown on good soil: They hear the word and receive it and bear fruit, one thirty times as much, one sixty, and one a hundred.”The Parable of the Lamp",
    "undefined He also said to them, “A lamp isn’t brought to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? Isn’t it to be placed on a lampstand? ",
    "undefined For nothing is hidden except to be re-vealed, and nothing concealed except to be brought to light. ",
    "undefined If anyone has ears to hear, he had better listen!” ",
    "undefined And he said to them, “Take care about what you hear. The measure you use will be the measure you re-ceive, and more will be added to you. ",
    "undefined For whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.”The Parable of the Growing Seed",
    "undefined He also said, “The kingdom of God is like someone who spreads seed on the ground. ",
    "undefined He goes to sleep and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. ",
    "undefined By itself the soil produces a crop, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head. ",
    "undefined And when the grain is ripe, he sends in the sickle because the harvest has come.”The Parable of the Mustard Seed ",
    "undefined He also asked, “To what can we com-pare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to present it? ",
    "undefined It is like a mustard seed that when sown in the ground, even though it is the smallest of all the seeds in the ground – ",
    "undefined when it is sown, it grows up, becomes the greatest of all garden plants, and grows large branches so that the wild birds can nest in its shade.”The Use of Parables ",
    "undefined So with many parables like these, he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear. ",
    "undefined He did not speak to them without a parable. But privately he explained everything to his own disciples.Stilling of a Storm ",
    "undefined On that day, when evening came, Je-sus said to his disciples, “Let’s go across to the other side of the lake.” ",
    "undefined So after leaving the crowd, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat, and other boats were with him. ",
    "undefined Now a great windstorm developed and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was nearly swamped. ",
    "undefined But he was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. They woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are about to die?” ",
    "undefined So he got up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Be quiet! Calm down!” Then the wind stopped, and it was dead calm. ",
    "undefined And he said to them, “Why are you cowardly? Do you still not have faith?” ",
    "undefined They were over-whelmed by fear and said to one another, “Who then is this? Even the wind and sea obey him!”Healing of a Demoniac "
  ],
  [
    " So they came to the other side of the lake, to the region of the Gerasenes. ",
    "undefined Just as Jesus was getting out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came from the tombs and met him. ",
    "undefined He lived among the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain. ",
    "undefined For his hands and feet had often been bound with chains and shackles, but he had torn the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces. No one was strong enough to subdue him. ",
    "undefined Each night and every day among the tombs and in the mountains, he would cry out and cut himself with stones. ",
    "undefined When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before him. ",
    "undefined Then he cried out with a loud voice, “Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! I implore you by God – do not torment me!” ",
    "undefined (For Jesus had said to him, “Come out of that man, you unclean spirit!”) ",
    "undefined Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “My name is Legion, for we are many.” ",
    "undefined He begged Jesus repeated-ly not to send them out of the region. ",
    "undefined There on the hillside, a great herd of pigs was feeding. ",
    "undefined And the demonic spirits begged him, “Send us into the pigs. Let us enter them.” ",
    "undefined Jesus gave them permission. So the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs. Then the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake, and about two thousand were drowned in the lake. ",
    "undefined Now the herdsmen ran off and spread the news in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. ",
    "undefined They came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind – the one who had the “Legion” – and they were afraid. ",
    "undefined Those who had seen what had happened to the demon-possessed man reported it, and they also told about the pigs. ",
    "undefined Then they asked Jesus to leave their region. ",
    "undefined As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed asked if he could go with him. ",
    "undefined But Jesus did not permit him to do so. Instead, he said to him, “Go to your home and to your people and tell them what the Lord has done for you, that he had mercy on you.” ",
    "undefined So he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what Jesus had done for him, and all were amazed.Restoration and Healing ",
    "undefined When Jesus had crossed again in a boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and he was by the sea. ",
    "undefined Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came up, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet. ",
    "undefined He asked him urgently, “My little daughter is near death. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may be healed and live.” ",
    "undefined Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around him.",
    "undefined Now a woman was there who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years. ",
    "undefined She had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all that she had. Yet instead of getting better, she grew worse. ",
    "undefined When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, ",
    "undefined for she kept saying, “If only I touch his clothes, I will be healed.” ",
    "undefined At once the bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. ",
    "undefined Jesus knew at once that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?” ",
    "undefined His disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing against you and you say, ‘Who touched me?’” ",
    "undefined But he looked around to see who had done it. ",
    "undefined Then the woman, with fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. ",
    "undefined He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your dis-ease.”",
    "undefined While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter has died. Why trouble the teacher any longer?” ",
    "undefined But Jesus, paying no attention to what was said, told the synagogue ruler, “Do not be afraid; just believe.” ",
    "undefined He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James. ",
    "undefined They came to the house of the synagogue ruler where he saw noisy confusion and people weeping and wailing loudly. ",
    "undefined When he entered he said to them, “Why are you dis-tressed and weeping? The child is not dead but asleep.” ",
    "undefined And they began making fun of him. But he put them all outside and he took the child’s father and mother and his own companions and went into the room where the child was. ",
    "undefined Then, gently taking the child by the hand, he said to her, “Talitha koum,” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up.” ",
    "undefined The girl got up at once and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). They were completely astonished at this. ",
    "undefined He strictly ordered that no one should know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.Rejection at Nazareth "

  [
    " Now Jesus left that place and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him. ",
    "undefined When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue. Many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did he get these ideas? And what is this wisdom that has been given to him? What are these miracles that are done through his hands? ",
    "undefined Isn’t this the car-penter, the son of Mary and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And aren’t his sisters here with us?” And so they took offense at him. ",
    "undefined Then Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, and among his relatives, and in his own house.” ",
    "undefined He was not able to do a miracle there, except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. ",
    "undefined And he was amazed because of their unbelief. Then he went around among the villages and taught.Sending Out the Twelve Apostles ",
    "undefined Jesus called the twelve and began to send them out two by two. He gave them au-thority over the unclean spirits. ",
    "undefined He in-structed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff – no bread, no bag, no money in their belts – ",
    "undefined and to put on sandals but not to wear two tunics. ",
    "undefined He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the area. ",
    "undefined If a place will not wel-come you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake the dust off your feet as a testi-mony against them.” ",
    "undefined So they went out and preached that all should repent. ",

    "undefined Now King Herod heard this, for Je-sus’ name had become known. Some were saying, “John the baptizer has been raised from the dead, and because of this, miraculous powers are at work in him.” ",
    "undefined Others said, “He is Elijah.” Others said, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets from the past.” ",
    "undefined But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised!” ",
    "undefined For Herod himself had sent men, arrested John, and bound him in prison on account of Hero-dias, his brother Philip’s wife, because Herod had married her. ",
    "undefined For John had repeatedly told Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” ",
    "undefined So Herodias nursed a grudge against him and wanted to kill him. But she could not ",
    "undefined because Herod stood in awe of John and protected him, since he knew that John was a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard him, he was thoroughly baffled, and yet he liked to listen to John. ",
    "undefined But a suitable day came, when Herod gave a banquet on his birthday for his court officials, military commanders, and leaders of Galilee. ",
    "undefined When his daughter Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you.” ",
    "undefined He swore to her, “What-ever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.” ",
    "undefined So she went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” Her mother said, “The head of John the baptizer.” ",
    "undefined Immediately she hurried back to the king and made her request: “I want the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.” ",
    "undefined Although it grieved the king deeply, he did not want to reject her request because of his oath and his guests. ",
    "undefined So the king sent an executioner at once to bring John’s head, and he went and beheaded John in prison. ",
    "undefined He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. ",
    "undefined When John’s disciples heard this, they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb.The Feeding of the Five Thousand",
    "undefined Then the apostles gathered around Je-sus and told him everything they had done and taught. ",
    "undefined He said to them, “Come with me privately to an isolated place and rest a while” (for many were coming and going, and there was no time to eat). ",
    "undefined So they went away by themselves in a boat to some remote place. ",
    "undefined But many saw them leaving and recognized them, and they hurried on foot from all the towns and arrived there ahead of them. ",
    "undefined As Jesus came ashore he saw the large crowd and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shep-herd. So he taught them many things.",
    "undefined When it was already late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is an isolated place and it is already very late. ",
    "undefined Send them away so that they can go into the sur-rounding countryside and villages and buy something for themselves to eat.” ",
