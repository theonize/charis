    "undefined For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world should be saved through him. ",
    "undefined The one who believes in him is not condemned. The one who does not be-lieve has been condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God. ",
    "undefined Now this is the basis for judging: that the light has come into the world and people loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil. ",
    "undefined For everyone who does evil deeds hates the light and does not come to the light, so that their deeds will not be exposed. ",
    "undefined But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, so that it may be plainly evident that his deeds have been done in God.Further Testimony About Jesus by John the Baptist",

    "undefined You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but rather, ‘I have been sent before him.’ ",
    "undefined The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands by and listens for him, rejoices greatly when he hears the bride-groom’s voice. This then is my joy, and it is complete. ",

    "undefined The one who comes from above is su-perior to all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is superior to all. ",
    "undefined He testifies about what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. ",
    "undefined The one who has accepted his testimony has confirmed clearly that God is truthful. ",
    "undefined For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he does not give the Spirit sparingly. ",
