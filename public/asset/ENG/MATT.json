    "undefined But they were indifferent and went away, one to his farm, another to his business. ",
    "undefined The rest seized his slaves, inso-lently mistreated them, and killed them. ",
    "undefined The king was furious! He sent his soldiers, and they put those murderers to death and set their city on fire. ",
    "undefined Then he said to his slaves, ‘The wedding is ready, but the ones who had been invited were not worthy. ",
    "undefined So go into the main streets and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet.’ ",
    "undefined And those slaves went out into the streets and gathered all they found, both bad and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. ",

    "undefined Tell us then, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”",
    "undefined But Jesus realized their evil inten-tions and said, “Hypocrites! Why are you test-ing me? ",
    "undefined Show me the coin used for the tax.” So they brought him a denarius. ",

    "undefined Last of all, the woman died. ",
    "undefined In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had married her.” ",
    "undefined Jesus an-swered them, “You are deceived, because you don’t know the scriptures or the power of God. ",
    "undefined For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. ",
    "undefined Now as for the resur-rection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, ",
    "undefined ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead but of the living!” ",

    "undefined This is the first and greatest commandment. ",
    "undefined The second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ ",
