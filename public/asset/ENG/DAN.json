    "undefined But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself with the royal delica-cies or the royal wine. He therefore asked the overseer of the court officials for permission not to defile himself. ",
    "undefined Then God made the overseer of the court officials sympathetic to Daniel. ",
    "undefined But he responded to Daniel, “I fear my master the king. He is the one who has decided your food and drink. What would happen if he saw that you looked malnour-ished in comparison to the other young men your age? If that happened, you would endan-ger my life with the king!” ",

    "undefined At the end of the ten days their ap-pearance was better and their bodies were healthier than all the young men who had been eating the royal delicacies. ",
    "undefined So the warden removed the delicacies and the wine from their diet and gave them a diet of vegetables in-stead. ",
    "undefined Now as for these four young men, God endowed them with knowledge and skill in all sorts of literature and wisdom – and Daniel had insight into all kinds of visions and dreams. ",
    "undefined When the time appointed by the king arrived, the overseer of the court officials brought them into Nebuchadnezzar’s presence. ",
    "undefined When the king spoke with them, he did not find among the entire group anyone like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, or Azariah. So they entered the king’s service. ",
