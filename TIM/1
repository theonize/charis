TIM/1,54,1,1,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to a command of God our Saviour, and of the Lord Jesus Christ our hope,"
TIM/1,54,1,2,"to Timotheus -- genuine child in faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God our Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord,"
TIM/1,54,1,3,"according as I did exhort thee to remain in Ephesus -- I going on to Macedonia -- that thou mightest charge certain not to teach any other thing,"
TIM/1,54,1,4,"nor to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, that cause questions rather than the building up of God that is in faith: --"
TIM/1,54,1,5,"And the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned,"
TIM/1,54,1,6,"from which certain, having swerved, did turn aside to vain discourse,"
TIM/1,54,1,7,"willing to be teachers of law, not understanding either the things they say, nor concerning what they asseverate,"
TIM/1,54,1,8,"and we have known that the law  good, if any one may use it lawfully;"
TIM/1,54,1,9,"having known this, that for a righteous man law is not set, but for lawless and insubordinate persons, ungodly and sinners, impious and profane, parricides and matricides, men-slayers,"
TIM/1,54,1,10,"whoremongers, sodomites, men-stealers, liars, perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that to sound doctrine is adverse,"
TIM/1,54,1,11,"according to the good news of the glory of the blessed God, with which I was entrusted."
TIM/1,54,1,12,"And I give thanks to him who enabled me -- Christ Jesus our Lord -- that he did reckon me stedfast, having put `me' to the ministration,"
TIM/1,54,1,13,"who before was speaking evil, and persecuting, and insulting, but I found kindness, because, being ignorant, I did `it' in unbelief,"
TIM/1,54,1,14,"and exceedingly abound did the grace of our Lord, with faith and love that  in Christ Jesus:"
TIM/1,54,1,15,"stedfast  the word, and of all acceptation worthy, that Christ Jesus came to the world to save sinners -- first of whom I am;"
TIM/1,54,1,16,"but because of this I found kindness, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern of those about to believe on him to life age-during:"
TIM/1,54,1,17,"and to the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only wise God,  honour and glory -- to the ages of the ages! Amen."
TIM/1,54,1,18,"This charge I commit to thee, child Timotheus, according to the prophesies that went before upon thee, that thou mayest war in them the good warfare,"
TIM/1,54,1,19,"having faith and a good conscience, which certain having thrust away, concerning the faith did make shipwreck,"
TIM/1,54,1,20,"of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I did deliver to the Adversary, that they might be instructed not to speak evil."
TIM/1,54,2,1,"I exhort, then, first of all, there be made supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, for all men:"
TIM/1,54,2,2,"for kings, and all who are in authority, that a quiet and peaceable life we may lead in all piety and gravity,"
TIM/1,54,2,3,"for this  right and acceptable before God our Saviour,"
TIM/1,54,2,4,"who doth will all men to be saved, and to come to the full knowledge of the truth;"
TIM/1,54,2,5,"for one  God, one also  mediator of God and of men, the man Christ Jesus,"
TIM/1,54,2,6,who did give himself a ransom for all -- the testimony in its own times --
TIM/1,54,2,7,"in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle -- truth I say in Christ, I do not lie -- a teacher of nations, in faith and truth."
TIM/1,54,2,8,"I wish, therefore, that men pray in every place, lifting up kind hands, apart from anger and reasoning;"
TIM/1,54,2,9,"in like manner also the women, in becoming apparel, with modesty and sobriety to adorn themselves, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or garments of great price,"
TIM/1,54,2,10,but -- which becometh women professing godly piety -- through good works.
TIM/1,54,2,11,"Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection,"
TIM/1,54,2,12,"and a woman I do not suffer to teach, nor to rule a husband, but to be in quietness,"
TIM/1,54,2,13,"for Adam was first formed, then Eve,"
TIM/1,54,2,14,"and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, into transgression came,"
TIM/1,54,2,15,"and she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety."
TIM/1,54,3,1,"Stedfast  the word: If any one the oversight doth long for, a right work he desireth;"
TIM/1,54,3,2,"it behoveth, therefore, the overseer to be blameless, of one wife a husband, vigilant, sober, decent, a friend of strangers, apt to teach,"
TIM/1,54,3,3,"not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre, but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money,"
TIM/1,54,3,4,"his own house leading well, having children in subjection with all gravity,"
TIM/1,54,3,5,"(and if any one his own house `how' to lead hath not known, how an assembly of God shall he take care of?)"
TIM/1,54,3,6,"not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall to a judgment of the devil;"
TIM/1,54,3,7,"and it behoveth him also to have a good testimony from those without, that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the devil."
TIM/1,54,3,8,"Ministrants -- in like manner grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not given to filthy lucre,"
TIM/1,54,3,9,"having the secret of the faith in a pure conscience,"
TIM/1,54,3,10,"and let these also first be proved, then let them minister, being unblameable."
TIM/1,54,3,11,"Women -- in like manner grave, not false accusers, vigilant, faithful in all things."
TIM/1,54,3,12,"Ministrants -- let them be of one wife husbands; the children leading well, and their own houses,"
TIM/1,54,3,13,"for those who did minister well a good step to themselves do acquire, and much boldness in faith that  in Christ Jesus."
TIM/1,54,3,14,"These things I write to thee, hoping to come unto thee soon,"
TIM/1,54,3,15,"and if I delay, that thou mayest know how it behoveth `thee' to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is an assembly of the living God -- a pillar and foundation of the truth,"
TIM/1,54,3,16,"and, confessedly, great is the secret of piety -- God was manifested in flesh, declared righteous in spirit, seen by messengers, preached among nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory!"
TIM/1,54,4,1,"And the Spirit expressly speaketh, that in latter times shall certain fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and teachings of demons,"
TIM/1,54,4,2,"in hypocrisy speaking lies, being seared in their own conscience,"
TIM/1,54,4,3,"forbidding to marry -- to abstain from meats that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those believing and acknowledging the truth,"
TIM/1,54,4,4,"because every creature of God  good, and nothing  to be rejected, with thanksgiving being received,"
TIM/1,54,4,5,for it is sanctified through the word of God and intercession.
TIM/1,54,4,6,"These things placing before the brethren, thou shalt be a good ministrant of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words of the faith, and of the good teaching, which thou didst follow after,"
TIM/1,54,4,7,"and the profane and old women's fables reject thou, and exercise thyself unto piety,"
TIM/1,54,4,8,"for the bodily exercise is unto little profit, and the piety is to all things profitable, a promise having of the life that now is, and of that which is coming;"
TIM/1,54,4,9,"stedfast  the word, and of all acceptation worthy;"
TIM/1,54,4,10,"for for this we both labour and are reproached, because we hope on the living God, who is Saviour of all men -- especially of those believing."
TIM/1,54,4,11,"Charge these things, and teach;"
TIM/1,54,4,12,"let no one despise thy youth, but a pattern become thou of those believing in word, in behaviour, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity;"
TIM/1,54,4,13,"till I come, give heed to the reading, to the exhortation, to the teaching;"
TIM/1,54,4,14,"be not careless of the gift in thee, that was given thee through prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the eldership;"
TIM/1,54,4,15,"of these things be careful; in these things be, that thy advancement may be manifest in all things;"
TIM/1,54,4,16,"take heed to thyself, and to the teaching; remain in them, for this thing doing, both thyself thou shalt save, and those hearing thee."
TIM/1,54,5,1,"An aged person thou mayest not rebuke, but be entreating as a father; younger persons as brethren;"
TIM/1,54,5,2,"aged women as mothers, younger ones as sisters -- in all purity;"
TIM/1,54,5,3,honour widows who are really widows;
TIM/1,54,5,4,"and if any widow have children or grandchildren, let them learn first to their own house to show piety, and to give back a recompense to the parents, for this is right and acceptable before God."
TIM/1,54,5,5,"And she who is really a widow and desolate, hath hoped upon God, and doth remain in the supplications and in the prayers night and day,"
TIM/1,54,5,6,"and she who is given to luxury, living -- hath died;"
TIM/1,54,5,7,"and these things charge, that they may be blameless;"
TIM/1,54,5,8,"and if any one for his own -- and especially for those of the household -- doth not provide, the faith he hath denied, and than an unbeliever he is worse."
TIM/1,54,5,9,"A widow -- let her not be enrolled under sixty years of age, having been a wife of one husband,"
TIM/1,54,5,10,"in good works being testified to: if she brought up children, if she entertained strangers, if holy-ones' feet she washed, if those in tribulation she relieved, if every good work she followed after;"
TIM/1,54,5,11,"and younger widows be refusing, for when they may revel against the Christ, they wish to marry,"
TIM/1,54,5,12,"having judgment, because the first faith they did cast away,"
TIM/1,54,5,13,"and at the same time also, they learn `to be' idle, going about the houses; and not only idle, but also tattlers and busybodies, speaking the things they ought not;"
TIM/1,54,5,14,"I wish, therefore, younger ones to marry, to bear children, to be mistress of the house, to give no occasion to the opposer to reviling;"
TIM/1,54,5,15,for already certain did turn aside after the Adversary.
TIM/1,54,5,16,"If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the assembly be burdened, that those really widows it may relieve."
TIM/1,54,5,17,"The well-leading elders of double honour let them be counted worthy, especially those labouring in word and teaching,"
TIM/1,54,5,18,"for the Writing saith, `An ox treading out thou shalt not muzzle,' and `Worthy  the workman of his reward.'"
TIM/1,54,5,19,"Against an elder an accusation receive not, except upon two or three witnesses."
TIM/1,54,5,20,"Those sinning, reprove before all, that the others also may have fear;"
TIM/1,54,5,21,"I testify fully, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the choice messengers, that these things thou mayest keep, without forejudging, doing nothing by partiality."
TIM/1,54,5,22,"Be laying hands quickly on no one, nor be having fellowship with sins of others; be keeping thyself pure;"
TIM/1,54,5,23,"no longer be drinking water, but a little wine be using, because of thy stomach and of thine often infirmities;"
TIM/1,54,5,24,"of certain men the sins are manifest beforehand, leading before to judgment, and certain also they follow after;"
TIM/1,54,5,25,"in like manner also the right works are manifest beforehand, and those that are otherwise are not able to be hid."
TIM/1,54,6,1,"As many as are servants under a yoke, their own masters worthy of all honour let them reckon, that the name of God and the teaching may not be evil spoken of;"
TIM/1,54,6,2,"and those having believing masters, let them not slight `them', because they are brethren, but rather let them serve, because they are stedfast and beloved, who of the benefit are partaking. These things be teaching and exhorting;"
TIM/1,54,6,3,"if any one be teaching otherwise, and do not consent to sound words -- those of our Lord Jesus Christ -- and to the teaching according to piety,"
TIM/1,54,6,4,"he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and word-striving, out of which doth come envy, strife, evil-speakings, evil-surmisings,"
TIM/1,54,6,5,"wranglings of men wholly corrupted in mind, and destitute of the truth, supposing the piety to be gain; depart from such;"
TIM/1,54,6,6,but it is great gain -- the piety with contentment;
TIM/1,54,6,7,for nothing did we bring into the world -- `it is' manifest that we are able to carry nothing out;
TIM/1,54,6,8,but having food and raiment -- with these we shall suffice ourselves;
TIM/1,54,6,9,"and those wishing to be rich, do fall into temptation and a snare, and many desires, foolish and hurtful, that sink men into ruin and destruction,"
TIM/1,54,6,10,"for a root of all the evils is the love of money, which certain longing for did go astray from the faith, and themselves did pierce through with many sorrows;"
TIM/1,54,6,11,"and thou, O man of God, these things flee, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, meekness;"
TIM/1,54,6,12,"be striving the good strife of the faith, be laying hold on the life age-during, to which also thou wast called, and didst profess the right profession before many witnesses."
TIM/1,54,6,13,"I charge thee, before God, who is making all things alive, and of Christ Jesus, who did testify before Pontius Pilate the right profession,"
TIM/1,54,6,14,"that thou keep the command unspotted, unblameable, till the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
TIM/1,54,6,15,"which in His own times He shall shew -- the blessed and only potentate, the King of the kings and Lord of the lords,"
TIM/1,54,6,16,"who only is having immortality, dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no one of men did see, nor is able to see, to whom  honour and might age-during! Amen."
TIM/1,54,6,17,"Those rich in the present age charge thou not to be high-minded, nor to hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, who is giving to us all things richly for enjoyment; --"
TIM/1,54,6,18,"to do good, to be rich in good works, to be ready to impart, willing to communicate,"
TIM/1,54,6,19,"treasuring up to themselves a right foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life age-during."
TIM/1,54,6,20,"O Timotheus, the thing entrusted guard thou, avoiding the profane vain-words and opposition of the falsely-named knowledge,"
TIM/1,54,6,21,which certain professing -- concerning the faith did swerve; the grace  with you. Amen.
