"The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh  on me, Because Yahweh did anoint me To proclaim tidings to the humble, He sent me to bind the broken of heart, To proclaim to captives liberty, And to bound ones an opening of bands."
"To proclaim the year of the good pleasure of Yahweh, And the day of vengeance of our God, To comfort all mourners."
"To appoint to mourners in Zion, To give to them beauty instead of ashes, The oil of joy instead of mourning, A covering of praise for a spirit of weakness, And He is calling to them, `Trees of righteousness, The planting of Yahweh -- to be beautified.'"
"And they have built the wastes of old, The desolations of the ancients they raise up, And they have renewed waste cities, The desolations of generation and generation."
"And strangers have stood and fed your flock, Sons of a foreigner `are' your husbandmen, And your vine-dressers."
"And ye are called `Priests of Yahweh,' `Ministers of our God,' is said of you, The strength of nations ye consume, And in their honour ye do boast yourselves."
"Instead of your shame and confusion, A second time they sing of their portion, Therefore in their land A second time do they take possession, Joy age-during  for them."
"For I `am' Yahweh, loving judgment, Hating plunder for a burnt-offering, And I have given their wage in truth, And a covenant age-during I make for them."
"And known among nations hath been their seed, And their offspring in the midst of the peoples, All their beholders acknowledge them, For they `are' a seed Yahweh hath blessed."
"I greatly rejoice in Yahweh, Joy doth my soul in my God, For He clothed me with garments of salvation, With a robe of righteousness covereth Me, As a bridegroom prepareth ornaments, And as a bride putteth on her jewels."
"For, as the earth bringeth forth her shoots, And as a garden causeth its sown things to shoot up, So the Lord Yahweh causeth righteousness and praise To shoot up before all the nations!"
