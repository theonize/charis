"They joy from the wilderness and dry place, And rejoice doth the desert, and flourish as the rose,"
"Flourishing it doth flourish, and rejoice, Yea, `with' joy and singing, The honour of Lebanon hath been given to it, The beauty of Carmel and Sharon, They -- they see the honour of Yahweh, The majesty of our God."
"Strengthen ye the feeble hands, Yea, the stumbling knees strengthen."
"Say to the hastened of heart, `Be strong, Fear not, lo, your God; vengeance cometh, The recompence of God, He Himself doth come and save you.'"
"Then opened are eyes of the blind, And ears of the deaf are unstopped,"
"Then leap as a hart doth the lame, And sing doth the tongue of the dumb, For broken up in a wilderness have been waters, And streams in a desert."
"And the mirage hath become a pond, And the thirsty land fountains of waters, In the habitation of dragons, Its place of couching down, a court for reed and rush."
"And a highway hath been there, and a way, And the `way of holiness' is called to it, Not pass over it doth the unclean, And He Himself  by them, Whoso is going in the way -- even fools err not."
"No lion is there, yea, a destructive beast Ascendeth it not, it is not found there, And walked have the redeemed,"
"And the ransomed of Yahweh return, And have entered Zion with singing. And joy age-during on their head, Joy and gladness they attain, And fled away have sorrow and sighing!"
