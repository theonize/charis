"And I lift up mine eyes, and look, and lo, a man, and in his hand a measuring line."
"And I say, `Whither are thou going?' And he saith unto me, `To measure Jerusalem, to see how much  its breadth, and how much its length.'"
"And lo, the messenger who is speaking with me is going out, and another messenger is going out to meet him,"
"and he saith unto him, `Run, speak unto this young man, saying: Unwalled villages inhabit doth Jerusalem, From the abundance of man and beast in her midst."
"And I -- I am to her -- an affirmation of Yahweh, A wall of fire round about, And for honour I am in her midst."
"Ho, ho, and flee from the land of the north, An affirmation of Yahweh, For, as the four winds of the heavens, I have spread you abroad, An affirmation of Yahweh."
"Ho, Zion, be delivered who art dwelling `with' the daughter of Babylon."
"For thus said Yahweh of Hosts: After honour He hath sent me unto the nations who are spoiling you, For he who is coming against you, Is coming against the daughter of His eye."
"For lo, I am waving my hand against them, And they have been a spoil to their servants. And ye have known that Yahweh of Hosts hath sent me."
"Singe, and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, For lo, I am coming, and have dwelt in thy midst, An affirmation of Yahweh."
"And joined have been many nations unto Yahweh in that day, And they have been to Me for a people, And I have dwelt in thy midst, And thou hast known that Yahweh of Hosts hath sent me unto thee."
"And Yahweh hath inherited Judah, His portion on the holy ground, And He hath fixed again on Jerusalem."
"Hush, all flesh, because of Yahweh, For He hath been roused up from His holy habitation!'"
