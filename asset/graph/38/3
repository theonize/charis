"And he sheweth me Joshua the high priest standing before the messenger of Yahweh, and the Adversary standing at his right hand, to be an adversary to him."
"And Yahweh saith unto the Adversary: `Yahweh doth push against thee, O Adversary, Yea, push against thee doth Yahweh, Who is fixing on Jerusalem, Is not this a brand delivered from fire?'"
"And Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and is standing before the messenger."
"And he answereth and speaketh unto those standing before him, saying: `Turn aside the filthy garments from off him.' And he saith unto him, `See, I have caused thine iniquity to pass away from off thee, so as to clothe thee with costly apparel.'"
"He also said, `Let them set a pure diadem on his head. And they set the pure diadem on his head, and clothe him with garments. And the messenger of Yahweh is standing,"
"and the messenger of Yahweh doth protest to Joshua, saying:"
"`Thus said Yahweh of Hosts: If in My ways thou dost walk, And if My charge thou dost keep, Then also thou dost judge My house, And also thou dost keep My courts, And I have given to thee conductors among these standing by."
"Hear, I pray thee, Joshua, the high priest, Thou and thy companions sitting before thee, (For men of type `are' they,) For lo, I am bringing in My servant -- a Shoot."
"For lo, the stone that I put before Joshua, On one stone `are' seven eyes, Lo, I am graving its graving, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts, And I have removed the iniquity of that land in one day."
"In that day -- an affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts, Ye do call, each unto his neighbour, Unto the place of the vine, And unto the place of the fig-tree!'"
