"To the Overseer, `On the Death of Labben.' -- A Psalm of David. I confess, O Yahweh, with all my heart, I recount all Thy wonders,"
"I rejoice and exult in Thee, I praise Thy Name, O Most High."
"In mine enemies turning backward, they stumble and perish from Thy face."
"For Thou hast done my judgment and my right. Thou hast sat on a throne, A judge of righteousness."
"Thou hast rebuked nations, Thou hast destroyed the wicked, Their name Thou hast blotted out to the age and for ever."
"O thou Enemy, Finished have been destructions for ever, As to cities thou hast plucked up, Perished hath their memorial with them."
"And Yahweh to the age abideth, He is preparing for judgment His throne."
"And He judgeth the world in righteousness, He judgeth the peoples in uprightness."
"And Yahweh is a tower for the bruised, A tower for times of adversity."
"They trust in Thee who do know Thy name, For Thou hast not forsaken Those seeking Thee, O Yahweh."
"Sing ye praise to Yahweh, inhabiting Zion, Declare ye among the peoples His acts,"
"For He who is seeking for blood Them hath remembered, He hath not forgotten the cry of the afflicted."
"Favour me, O Yahweh, See mine affliction by those hating me, Thou who liftest me up from the gates of death,"
"So that I recount all Thy praise, In the gates of the daughter of Zion. I rejoice on Thy salvation."
"Sunk have nations in a pit they made, In a net that they hid hath their foot been captured."
"Yahweh hath been known, Judgment He hath done, By a work of his hands Hath the wicked been snared. Meditation. Selah."
"The wicked do turn back to Sheol, All nations forgetting God."
"For not for ever is the needy forgotten, The hope of the humble lost to the age."
"Rise, O Yahweh, let not man be strong, Let nations be judged before Thy face."
"Appoint, O Yahweh, a director to them, Let nations know they `are' men! Selah."
