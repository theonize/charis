"A Psalm of David. To Yahweh  the earth and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it."
"For He on the seas hath founded it, And on the floods He doth establish it."
Who goeth up into the hill of Yahweh? And who riseth up in His holy place?
"The clean of hands, and pure of heart, Who hath not lifted up to vanity his soul, Nor hath sworn to deceit."
"He beareth away a blessing from Yahweh, Righteousness from the God of his salvation."
"This  a generation of those seeking Him. Seeking Thy face, O Jacob! Selah."
"Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!"
"Who  this -- `the king of glory?' Yahweh -- strong and mighty, Yahweh, the mighty in battle."
"Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!"
Who  He -- this `king of glory?' Yahweh of hosts -- He  the king of glory! Selah.
