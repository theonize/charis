"Come, we sing to Yahweh, We shout to the rock of our salvation."
"We come before His face with thanksgiving, With psalms we shout to Him."
"For a great God  Yahweh, And a great king over all gods."
"In whose hand `are' the deep places of earth, And the strong places of hills `are' His."
"Whose is the sea, and He made it, And His hands formed the dry land."
"Come in, we bow ourselves, and we bend, We kneel before Yahweh our Maker."
"For He  our God, and we the people of His pasture, And the flock of His hand, To-day, if to His voice ye hearken,"
"Harden not your heart as `in' Meribah, As `in' the day of Massah in the wilderness,"
"Where your fathers have tried Me, Have proved Me, yea, have seen My work."
"Forty years I am weary of the generation, And I say, `A people erring in heart -- they! And they have not known My ways:'"
"Where I sware in Mine anger, `If they come in unto My rest -- !'"
