"A Psalm. -- A song of the dedication of the house of David. I exalt Thee, O Yahweh, For Thou hast drawn me up, and hast not let mine enemies rejoice over me."
"Yahweh my God, I have cried to Thee, And Thou dost heal me."
"Yahweh, Thou hast brought up from Sheol my soul, Thou hast kept me alive, From going down `to' the pit."
"Sing praise to Yahweh, ye His saints, And give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness,"
"For -- a moment  in His anger, Life  in His good-will, At even remaineth weeping, and at morn singing."
"And I -- I have said in mine ease, `I am not moved -- to the age."
"O Yahweh, in Thy good pleasure, Thou hast caused strength to remain for my mountain,' Thou hast hidden Thy face -- I have been troubled."
"Unto Thee, O Yahweh, I call, And unto Yahweh I make supplication."
`What gain  in my blood? In my going down unto corruption? Doth dust thank Thee? doth it declare Thy truth?
"Hear, O Yahweh, and favour me, O Yahweh, be a helper to me.'"
"Thou hast turned my mourning to dancing for me, Thou hast loosed my sackcloth, And girdest me `with' joy."
"So that honour doth praise Thee, and is not silent, O Yahweh, my God, to the age I thank Thee!"
