"Praise ye Jah! Praise, O my soul, Yahweh."
"I praise Yahweh during my life, I sing praise to my God while I exist."
"Trust not in princes -- in a son of man, For he hath no deliverance."
"His spirit goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, In that day have his thoughts perished."
"O the happiness of him Who hath the God of Jacob for his help, His hope  on Yahweh his God,"
"Making the heavens and earth, The sea and all that  in them, Who is keeping truth to the age,"
"Doing judgment for the oppressed, Giving bread to the hungry."
"Yahweh is loosing the prisoners, Yahweh is opening (the eyes of) the blind, Yahweh is raising the bowed down, Yahweh is loving the righteous,"
"Yahweh is preserving the strangers, The fatherless and widow He causeth to stand, And the way of the wicked He turneth upside down."
"Yahweh doth reign to the age, Thy God, O Zion, to generation and generation, Praise ye Jah!"
