"To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. A Psalm. All ye peoples, clap the hand, Shout to God with a voice of singing,"
"For Yahweh Most High  fearful, A great king over all the earth."
"He leadeth peoples under us, and nations under our feet."
"He doth choose for us our inheritance, The excellency of Jacob that He loves. Selah."
"God hath gone up with a shout, Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet."
"Praise God -- praise -- give praise to our king, praise."
"For king of all the earth  God, Give praise, O understanding one."
"God hath reigned over nations, God hath sat on His holy throne,"
"Nobles of peoples have been gathered, `With' the people of the God of Abraham, For to God `are' the shields of earth, Greatly hath He been exalted!"
