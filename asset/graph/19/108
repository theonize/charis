"A Song, a Psalm of David. Prepared is my heart, O God, I sing, yea, I sing praise, also my honour."
"Awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the dawn."
"I thank Thee among peoples, O Yahweh, And I praise Thee among the nations."
"For great above the heavens  Thy kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth."
"Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, And above all the earth Thy honour."
"That Thy beloved ones may be delivered, Save `with' Thy right hand, and answer us."
"God hath spoken in His holiness: I exult, I apportion Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I measure,"
"Mine  Gilead, mine  Manasseh, And Ephraim  the strength of my head, Judah  my lawgiver,"
"Moab  a pot for my washing, Upon Edom I cast my shoe, Over Philistia I shout habitually."
Who doth bring me in to the fenced city? Who hath led me unto Edom?
"Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off? And Thou goest not out, O God, with our hosts!"
"Give to us help from adversity, And vain is the salvation of man."
"In God we do mightily, And He doth tread down our adversaries!"
