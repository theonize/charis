"A Prayer of David. Hear, O Yahweh, righteousness, attend my cry, Give ear `to' my prayer, without lips of deceit."
From before thee my judgment doth go out; Thine eyes do see uprightly.
"Thou hast proved my heart, Thou hast inspected by night, Thou hast tried me, Thou findest nothing; My thoughts pass not over my mouth."
"As to doings of man, Through a word of Thy lips I have observed The paths of a destroyer;"
"To uphold my goings in Thy paths, My steps have not slidden."
"I -- I called Thee, for Thou dost answer me, O God, incline Thine ear to me, hear my speech."
"Separate wonderfully Thy kindness, O Saviour of the confiding, By Thy right hand, from withstanders."
"Keep me as the apple, the daughter of the eye; In shadow of Thy wings thou dost hide me."
From the face of the wicked who spoiled me. Mine enemies in soul go round against me.
"Their fat they have closed up, Their mouths have spoken with pride:"
`Our steps now have compassed `him';' Their eyes they set to turn aside in the land.
"His likeness as a lion desirous to tear, As a young lion dwelling in secret places."
"Arise, O Yahweh, go before his face, Cause him to bend. Deliver my soul from the wicked, Thy sword,"
"From men, Thy hand, O Yahweh, From men of the world, their portion  in life, And `with' Thy hidden things Thou fillest their belly, They are satisfied `with' sons; And have left their abundance to their sucklings."
"I -- in righteousness, I see Thy face; I am satisfied, in awaking, `with' Thy form!"
