"A Song of the Ascents, by David. I have rejoiced in those saying to me, `To the house of Yahweh we go.'"
"Our feet have been standing in thy gates, O Jerusalem!"
Jerusalem -- the builded one -- `Is' as a city that is joined to itself together.
"For thither have tribes gone up, Tribes of Jah, companies of Israel, To give thanks to the name of Yahweh."
"For there have sat thrones of judgment, Thrones of the house of David."
"Ask ye the peace of Jerusalem, At rest are those loving thee."
"Peace is in thy bulwark, rest in thy high places,"
"For the sake of my brethren and my companions, Let me speak, I pray thee, `Peace `be' in thee.'"
"For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I seek good for thee!"
