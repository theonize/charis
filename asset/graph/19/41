"To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. O the happiness of him Who is acting wisely unto the poor, In a day of evil doth Yahweh deliver him."
"Yahweh doth preserve him and revive him, He is happy in the land, And Thou givest him not into the will of his enemies."
"Yahweh supporteth on a couch of sickness, All his bed Thou hast turned in his weakness."
"I -- I said, `O Yahweh, favour me, Heal my soul, for I did sin against Thee,'"
Mine enemies say evil of me: When he dieth -- his name hath perished!
"And if he came to see -- vanity he speaketh, His heart gathereth iniquity to itself, He goeth out -- at the street he speaketh."
"All hating me whisper together against me, Against me they devise evil to me:"
"A thing of Belial is poured out on him, And because he lay down he riseth not again."
"Even mine ally, in whom I trusted, One eating my bread, made great the heel against me,"
"And Thou, Yahweh, favour me, And cause me to rise, And I give recompence to them."
"By this I have known, That Thou hast delighted in me, Because my enemy shouteth not over me."
"As to me, in mine integrity, Thou hast taken hold upon me, And causest me to stand before Thee to the age."
"Blessed  Yahweh, God of Israel, From the age -- and unto the age. Amen and Amen."
