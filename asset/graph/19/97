"Yahweh hath reigned, The earth is joyful, many isles rejoice."
"Cloud and darkness `are' round about Him, Righteousness and judgment the basis of His throne."
"Fire before Him goeth, And burneth round about His adversaries."
"Lightened have His lightnings the world, The earth hath seen, and is pained."
"Hills, like wax, melted before Yahweh, Before the Lord of all the earth."
"The heavens declared His righteousness, And all the peoples have seen His honour."
"Ashamed are all servants of a graven image, Those boasting themselves in idols, Bow yourselves to him, all ye gods."
"Zion hath heard and rejoiceth, And daughters of Judah are joyful, Because of Thy judgments, O Yahweh."
"For Thou, Yahweh, `art' Most High over all the earth, Greatly Thou hast been exalted over all gods."
"Ye who love Yahweh, hate evil, He is keeping the souls of His saints, From the hand of the wicked he delivereth them."
"Light  sown for the righteous, And for the upright of heart -- joy."
"Rejoice, ye righteous, in Yahweh, And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness!"
