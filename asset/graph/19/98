"A Psalm. Sing ye to Yahweh a new song, For wonders He hath done, Given salvation to Him hath His right hand and His holy arm."
"Yahweh hath made known His salvation, Before the eyes of the nations, He hath revealed His righteousness,"
"He hath remembered His kindness, And His faithfulness to the house of Israel, All ends of earth have seen the salvation of our God."
"Shout to Yahweh, all the earth, Break forth, and cry aloud, and sing."
"Sing to Yahweh with harp, With harp, and voice of praise,"
"With trumpets, and voice of a cornet, Shout ye before the king Yahweh."
"Roar doth the sea and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it."
"Floods clap hand, together hills cry aloud,"
"Before Yahweh, For He hath come to judge the earth, He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the people in uprightness!"
