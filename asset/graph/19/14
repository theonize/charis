"To the Overseer. -- By David. A fool hath said in his heart, `God is not;' They have done corruptly, They have done abominable actions, There is not a doer of good."
"Yahweh from the heavens Hath looked on the sons of men, To see if there is a wise one -- seeking God."
"The whole have turned aside, Together they have been filthy: There is not a doer of good, not even one."
"Have all working iniquity not known? Those consuming my people have eaten bread, Yahweh they have not called."
"There they have feared a fear, For God  in the generation of the righteous."
"The counsel of the poor ye cause to stink, Because Yahweh  his refuge."
"`Who doth give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When Yahweh doth turn back `To' a captivity of His people, Jacob doth rejoice -- Israel is glad!"
