"To the Overseer. -- A Song, a Psalm. Shout ye to God, all the earth."
"Praise ye the honour of His name, Make ye honourable His praise."
"Say to God, `How fearful `are' Thy works, By the abundance of Thy strength, Thine enemies feign obedience to Thee."
"All the earth do bow to Thee, They sing praise to Thee, they praise Thy name.' Selah."
"Come ye, and see the works of God, Fearful acts toward the sons of men."
"He hath turned a sea to dry land, Through a river they pass over on foot, There do we rejoice in Him."
"Ruling by His might to the age, His eyes among the nations do watch, The refractory exalt not themselves. Selah."
"Bless, ye peoples, our God, And sound the voice of His praise,"
"Who hath placed our soul in life, And suffered not our feet to be moved."
"For Thou hast tried us, O God, Thou hast refined us as the refining of silver."
"Thou hast brought us into a net, Thou hast placed pressure on our loins."
"Thou hast caused man to ride at our head. We have entered into fire and into water, And Thou bringest us out to a watered place."
"I enter Thy house with burnt-offerings, I complete to Thee my vows,"
"For opened were my lips, And my mouth spake in my distress:"
"`Burnt-offerings of fatlings I offer to Thee, With perfume of rams, I prepare a bullock with he-goats.' Selah."
"Come, hear, all ye who fear God, And I recount what he did for my soul."
"Unto Him `with' my mouth I have called, And exaltation  under my tongue."
"Iniquity, if I have seen in my heart, The Lord doth not hear."
"But God hath heard, He hath attended to the voice of my prayer."
"Blessed  God, Who hath not turned aside my prayer, And His loving-kindness, from me!"
