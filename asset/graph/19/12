"To the Overseer, on the octave. -- A Psalm of David. Save, Yahweh, for the saintly hath failed, For the stedfast have ceased From the sons of men:"
"Vanity they speak each with his neighbour, Lip of flattery! With heart and heart they speak."
"Yahweh doth cut off all lips of flattery, A tongue speaking great things,"
"Who said, `By our tongue we do mightily: Our lips `are' our own; who  lord over us?'"
"Because of the spoiling of the poor, Because of the groaning of the needy, Now do I arise, saith Yahweh, I set in safety `him who' doth breathe for it."
Sayings of Yahweh `are' pure sayings; Silver tried in a furnace of earth refined sevenfold.
"Thou, O Yahweh, dost preserve them, Thou keepest us from this generation to the age."
"Around the wicked walk continually, According as vileness is exalted by sons of men!"
