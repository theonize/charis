"To the Overseer. -- By sons of Korah. A Psalm. Thou hast accepted, O Yahweh, Thy land, Thou hast turned `to' the captivity of Jacob."
"Thou hast borne away the iniquity of Thy people, Thou hast covered all their sin. Selah."
"Thou hast gathered up all Thy wrath, Thou hast turned back from the fierceness of Thine anger."
"Turn back `to' us, O God of our salvation, And make void Thine anger with us."
To the age art Thou angry against us? Dost Thou draw out Thine anger To generation and generation?
"Dost Thou not turn back? Thou revivest us, And Thy people do rejoice in Thee."
"Show us, O Yahweh, thy kindness, And Thy salvation Thou dost give to us."
"I hear what God Yahweh speaketh, For He speaketh peace unto His people, And unto His saints, and they turn not back to folly."
"Only, near to those fearing Him  His salvation, That honour may dwell in our land."
"Kindness and truth have met, Righteousness and peace have kissed,"
"Truth from the earth springeth up, And righteousness from heaven looketh out,"
"Yahweh also giveth that which is good, And our land doth give its increase."
"Righteousness before Him goeth, And maketh His footsteps for a way!"
