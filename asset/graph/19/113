"Praise ye Jah! Praise, ye servants of Yahweh. Praise the name of Yahweh."
"The name of Yahweh is blessed, From henceforth, and unto the age."
"From the rising of the sun unto its going in, Praised  the name of Yahweh."
"High above all nations  Yahweh, Above the heavens  his honour."
"Who  as Yahweh our God, He is exalting `Himself' to sit?"
He is humbling `Himself' to look On the heavens and on the earth.
"He is raising up from the dust the poor, From a dunghill He exalteth the needy."
"To cause to sit with princes, With the princes of His people."
"Causing the barren one of the house to sit, A joyful mother of sons; praise ye Jah!"
