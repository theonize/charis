"To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. Yahweh, in Thy strength is the king joyful, In Thy salvation how greatly he rejoiceth."
"The desire of his heart Thou gavest to him, And the request of his lips Thou hast not withheld. Selah."
"For Thou puttest before him blessings of goodness, Thou settest on his head a crown of fine gold."
"Life he hath asked from Thee, Thou hast given to him -- length of days, Age-during -- and for ever."
"Great  his honour in Thy salvation, Honour and majesty Thou placest on him."
"For Thou makest him blessings for ever, Thou dost cause him to rejoice with joy, By Thy countenance."
"For the king is trusting in Yahweh, And in the kindness of the Most High He is not moved."
"Thy hand cometh to all Thine enemies, Thy right hand doth find Thy haters."
"Thou makest them as a furnace of fire, At the time of Thy presence. Yahweh in His anger doth swallow them, And fire doth devour them."
"Their fruit from earth Thou destroyest, And their seed from the sons of men."
"For they stretched out against Thee evil, They devised a wicked device, they prevail not,"
"For Thou makest them a butt, When Thy strings Thou preparest against their faces."
"Be Thou exalted, O Yahweh in, Thy strength, We sing and we praise Thy might!"
