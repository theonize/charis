"To the Overseer with stringed instruments, on the octave. -- A Psalm of David. O Yahweh, in Thine anger reprove me not, Nor in Thy fury chastise me."
"Favour me, O Yahweh, for I `am' weak, Heal me, O Yahweh, For troubled have been my bones,"
"And my soul hath been troubled greatly, And Thou, O Yahweh, till when?"
"Turn back, O Yahweh, draw out my soul, Save me for Thy kindness' sake."
"For there is not in death Thy memorial, In Sheol, who doth give thanks to Thee?"
"I have been weary with my sighing, I meditate through all the night `on' my bed, With my tear my couch I waste."
"Old from provocation is mine eye, It is old because of all mine adversaries,"
"Turn from me all ye workers of iniquity, For Yahweh heard the voice of my weeping,"
"Yahweh hath heard my supplication, Yahweh my prayer receiveth."
"Ashamed and troubled greatly are all mine enemies, They turn back -- ashamed `in' a moment!"
