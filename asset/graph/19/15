"A Psalm of David. Yahweh, who doth sojourn in Thy tent? Who doth dwell in Thy holy hill?"
"He who is walking uprightly, And working righteousness, And speaking truth in his heart."
"He hath not slandered by his tongue, He hath not done to his friend evil; And reproach he hath not lifted up Against his neighbour."
"Despised in his eyes  a rejected one, And those fearing Yahweh he doth honour. He hath sworn to suffer evil, and changeth not;"
"His silver he hath not given in usury, And a bribe against the innocent Hath not taken; Whoso is doing these is not moved to the age!"
