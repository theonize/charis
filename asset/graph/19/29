"A Psalm of David. Ascribe to Yahweh, ye sons of the mighty, Ascribe to Yahweh honour and strength."
"Ascribe to Yahweh the honour of His name, Bow yourselves to Yahweh, In the beauty of holiness."
"The voice of Yahweh  on the waters, The God of glory hath thundered, Yahweh  on many waters."
"The voice of Yahweh  with power, The voice of Yahweh  with majesty,"
"The voice of Yahweh  shivering cedars, Yea, Yahweh shivers the cedars of Lebanon."
"And He causeth them to skip as a calf, Lebanon and Sirion as a son of Reems,"
"The voice of Yahweh is hewing fiery flames,"
"The voice of Yahweh paineth a wilderness, Yahweh paineth the wilderness of Kadesh."
"The voice of Yahweh paineth the oaks, And maketh bare the forests, And in His temple every one saith, `Glory.'"
"Yahweh on the deluge hath sat, And Yahweh sitteth king -- to the age,"
"Yahweh strength to his people giveth, Yahweh blesseth His people with peace!"
