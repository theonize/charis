"A Psalm of David. Kindness and judgment I sing, To Thee, O Yahweh, I sing praise."
"I act wisely in a perfect way, When dost Thou come in unto me? I walk habitually in the integrity of my heart, In the midst of my house."
"I set not before mine eyes a worthless thing, The work of those turning aside I have hated, It adhereth not to me."
"A perverse heart turneth aside from me, Wickedness I know not."
"Whoso slandereth in secret his neighbour, Him I cut off, The high of eyes and proud of heart, him I endure not."
"Mine eyes are on the faithful of the land, To dwell with me, Whoso is walking in a perfect way, he serveth me."
"He dwelleth not in my house who is working deceit, Whoso is speaking lies Is not established before mine eyes."
"At morning I cut off all the wicked of the land, To cut off from the city of Yahweh All the workers of iniquity!"
