"To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. Yahweh doth answer thee, In a day of adversity, The name of the God of Jacob doth set thee on high,"
"He doth send thy help from the sanctuary, And from Zion doth support thee,"
"He doth remember all thy presents, And thy burnt-offering doth reduce to ashes. Selah."
"He doth give to thee according to thy heart, And all thy counsel doth fulfil."
"We sing of thy salvation, And in the name of our God set up a banner. Yahweh doth fulfil all thy requests."
"Now I have known That Yahweh hath saved His anointed, He answereth him from His holy heavens, With the saving might of His right hand."
"Some of chariots, and some of horses, And we of the name of Yahweh our God Make mention."
"They -- they have bowed and have fallen, And we have risen and station ourselves upright."
"O Yahweh, save the king, He doth answer us in the day we call!"
