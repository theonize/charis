"A Song of the Ascents. Unto Yahweh in my distress I have called, And He answereth me."
"O Yahweh, deliver my soul from a lying lip, From a deceitful tongue!"
What doth He give to thee? And what doth He add to thee? O deceitful tongue!
"Sharp arrows of a mighty one, with broom-coals."
"Wo to me, for I have inhabited Mesech, I have dwelt with tents of Kedar."
Too much hath my soul dwelt with him who is hating peace.
"I `am' peace, and when I speak they `are' for war!"
