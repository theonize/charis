"To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David. Till when, O Yahweh, Dost Thou forget me? -- for ever? Till when dost Thou hide Thy face from me?"
Till when do I set counsels in my soul? Sorrow inn my heart daily? Till when is mine enemy exalted over me?
"Look attentively; Answer me, O Yahweh, my God, Enlighten mine eyes, lest I sleep in death,"
"Lest mine enemy say, `I overcame him,' Mine adversaries joy when I am moved."
"And I, in Thy kindness I have trusted, Rejoice doth my heart in Thy salvation."
"I do sing to Yahweh, For He hath conferred benefits upon me!"
