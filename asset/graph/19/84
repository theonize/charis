"To the Overseer. -- `On the Gittith By sons of Korah.' -- A Psalm. How beloved Thy tabernacles, Yahweh of Hosts!"
"My soul desired, yea, it hath also been consumed, For the courts of Yahweh, My heart and my flesh cry aloud unto the living God,"
"(Even a sparrow hath found a house, And a swallow a nest for herself, Where she hath placed her brood,) Thine altars, O Yahweh of Hosts, My king and my God."
"O the happiness of those inhabiting Thy house, Yet do they praise Thee. Selah."
"O the happiness of a man whose strength is in Thee, Highways `are' in their heart."
"Those passing through a valley of weeping, A fountain do make it, Blessings also cover the director."
"They go from strength unto strength, He appeareth unto God in Zion."
"O Yahweh, God of Hosts, hear my prayer, Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah."
"Our shield, see, O God, And behold the face of Thine anointed,"
"For good  a day in Thy courts, O Teacher! I have chosen rather to be at the threshold, In the house of my God, Than to dwell in tents of wickedness."
"For a sun and a shield  Yahweh God, Grace and honour doth Yahweh give. He withholdeth not good To those walking in uprightness."
Yahweh of Hosts! O the happiness of a man trusting in Thee.
