"Whoredom is actually heard of among you, and such whoredom as is not even named among the nations -- as that one hath the wife of the father! --"
"and ye are having been puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he may be removed out of the midst of you who did this work,"
"for I indeed, as being absent as to the body, and present as to the spirit, have already judged, as being present, him who so wrought this thing:"
"in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ -- ye being gathered together, also my spirit -- with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
"to deliver up such a one to the Adversary for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
Not good  your glorying; have ye not known that a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven?
"cleanse out, therefore, the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened, for also our passover for us was sacrificed -- Christ,"
"so that we may keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of evil and wickedness, but with unleavened food of sincerity and truth."
"I did write to you in the epistle, not to keep company with whoremongers --"
"and not certainly with the whoremongers of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, seeing ye ought then to go forth out of the world --"
"and now, I did write to you not to keep company with `him', if any one, being named a brother, may be a whoremonger, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner -- with such a one not even to eat together;"
for what have I also those without to judge? those within do ye not judge?
and those without God doth judge; and put ye away the evil from among yourselves.
