"In his days hath Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon come up, and Jehoiakim is to him a servant three years; and he turneth and rebelleth against him,"
"and Yahweh sendeth against him the troops of the Chaldeans, and the troops of Aram, and the troops of Moab, and the troops of the sons of Ammon, and He sendeth them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Yahweh, that He spake by the hand of His servants the prophets;"
"only, by the command of Yahweh it hath been against Judah to turn `them' aside from His presence, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did,"
"and also the innocent blood that he hath shed, and he filleth Jerusalem with innocent blood, and Yahweh was not willing to forgive."
"And the rest of the matters of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah?"
"And Jehoiakim lieth with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son reigneth in his stead."
"And the king of Egypt hath not added any more to go out from his own land, for the king of Babylon hath taken, from the brook of Egypt unto the river Phrat, all that had been to the king of Egypt."
"A son of eighteen years  Jehoiachin in his reigning, and three months he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother  Nehushta, daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem,"
"and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his fathers did."
"At that time come up have servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and the city goeth into siege,"
"and Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon cometh against the city, and his servants are laying siege to it,"
"and Jehoiachin king of Judah goeth out unto the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his chiefs, and his eunuchs, and the king of Babylon taketh him in the eighth year of his reign,"
"and bringeth out thence all the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the house of the king, and cutteth in pieces all the vessels of gold that Solomon king of Israel made in the temple of Yahweh, as Yahweh had spoken."
"And he hath removed all Jerusalem, and all the chiefs, and all the mighty ones of valour -- ten thousand  the removal -- and every artificer and smith, none hath been left save the poor of the people of the land."
"And he removeth Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the mother of the king, and the wives of the king, and his eunuchs, and the mighty ones of the land -- he hath caused a removal to go from Jerusalem to Babylon,"
"and all the men of valour seven thousand, and the artificers and the smiths a thousand, the whole `are' mighty men, warriors; and the king of Babylon bringeth them in a captivity to Babylon."
"And the king of Babylon causeth Mattaniah his father's brother to reign in his stead, and turneth his name to Zedekiah."
"A son of twenty and one years  Zedekiah in his reigning, and eleven years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother  Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah,"
"and he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Yahweh according to all that Jehoiakim did,"
"for, by the anger of Yahweh it hath been against Jerusalem and against Judah, till he cast them out from His presence, that Zedekiah rebelleth against the king of Babylon."
