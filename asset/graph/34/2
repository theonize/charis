"For turned back hath Yahweh to the excellency of Jacob, As `to' the excellency of Israel, For emptied them out have emptiers, And their branches they have marred."
"The shield of his mighty ones is become red, Men of might `are in' scarlet, With fiery torches  the chariot in a day of his preparation, And the firs have been caused to tremble."

"Lo, I `am' against thee, An affirmation of Yahweh of Hosts, And I have burned in smoke its chariot, And thy young lions consume doth a sword, And I have cut off from the land thy prey, And not heard any more is the voice of thy messengers!"
