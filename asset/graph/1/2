"And the heavens and the earth are completed, and all their host;"
"V'CL ALH'M by the seventh day His work which He hath made, and ceaseth by the seventh day from all His work which He hath made."
"V'BRD ALH'M the seventh day, and sanctifieth it, for in it He hath ceased from all His work A$R_BRA ALH'M for making."
"These `are' births of the heavens and of the earth in their being prepared, in the day of 'HVH ALH'M making earth and heavens;"
"and no shrub of the field is yet in the earth, and no herb of the field yet sprouteth, for 'HVH ALH'M hath not rained upon the earth, and a man there is not to serve the ground,"
"and a mist goeth up from the earth, and hath watered the whole face of the ground."
"V''ZR 'HVH ALH'M A+_HADM -- dust from the ground, and breatheth into his nostrils breath of life, and the man becometh a living creature."
"V'TY 'HVH ALH'M a garden in Eden, at the east, and He setteth there the man whom He hath formed;"
"V'ZMK 'HVH ALH'M from soil all tree desirable for appearance, and good for food, and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."
"And a river is going out from Eden to water the garden, and from thence it is parted, and hath become four chief `rivers';"
"the name of the one Pison, it that which is surrounding the whole land of the Havilah where the gold,"
"and the gold of that land  good, there  the bdolach and the shoham stone;"
"and the name of the second river  Gibon, it  that which is surrounding the whole land of Cush;"
"and the name of the third river  Hiddekel, it  that which is going east of Asshur; and the fourth river is Phrat."
"V'QK 'HVH ALH'M A+_HADM, and causeth him to rest in the garden of Eden, to serve it, and to keep it."
"V'ZV 'HVH ALH'M a charge on the man, saying, `Of every tree of the garden eating thou dost eat;"
"and of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou dost not eat of it, for in the day of thine eating of it -- dying thou dost die.'"
"V'AMR 'HVH ALH'M, `Not good for the man to be alone, I do make to him an helper -- as his counterpart.'"
"V'ZR 'HVH ALH'M from the ground every beast of the field, and every fowl of the heavens, and bringeth in unto the man, to see what he doth call it; and whatever the man calleth a living creature, that  its name."
"And the man calleth names to all the cattle, and to fowl of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; and to man hath not been found an helper -- as his counterpart."
"V'PL 'HVH ALH'M deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he sleepeth, and He taketh one of his ribs, and closeth up flesh in its stead."
"V'BN 'HVH ALH'M the side which He hath taken out of the man into a woman, and bringeth her in unto the man;"
"and the man saith, `This  the `proper' step! bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh!' for this it is called Woman, for from a man hath this been taken;"
"therefore doth a man leave his father and his mother, and hath cleaved unto his wife, and they have become one flesh."
"And they are both of them naked, the man and his wife, and they are not ashamed of themselves."
