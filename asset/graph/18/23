And Job answereth and saith: --
"Also -- to-day  my complaint bitter, My hand hath been heavy because of my sighing."
"O that I had known -- and I find Him, I come in unto His seat,"
"I arrange before Him the cause, And my mouth fill `with' arguments."
"I know the words He doth answer me, And understand what He saith to me."
In the abundance of power doth He strive with me? No! surely He putteth `it' in me.
"There the upright doth reason with Him, And I escape for ever from my judge."
"Lo, forward I go -- and He is not, And backward -- and I perceive him not."
"`To' the left in His working -- and I see not, He is covered `on' the right, and I behold not."
"For He hath known the way with me, He hath tried me -- as gold I go forth."
"On His step hath my foot laid hold, His way I have kept, and turn not aside,"
"The command of His lips, and I depart not. Above my allotted portion I have laid up The sayings of His mouth."
"And He  in one `mind', And who doth turn Him back? And His soul hath desired -- and He doth `it'."
"For He doth complete my portion, And many such things `are' with Him."
"Therefore, from His presence I am troubled, I consider, and am afraid of Him."
"And God hath made my heart soft, And the Mighty hath troubled me."
"For I have not been cut off before darkness, And before me He covered thick darkness."
