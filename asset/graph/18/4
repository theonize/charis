And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: --
Hath one tried a word with thee? -- Thou art weary! And to keep in words who is able?
"Lo, thou hast instructed many, And feeble hands thou makest strong."
"The stumbling one do thy words raise up, And bowing knees thou dost strengthen."
"But now, it cometh in unto thee, And thou art weary; It striketh unto thee, and thou art troubled."
Is not thy reverence thy confidence? Thy hope -- the perfection of thy ways?
"Remember, I pray thee, Who, being innocent, hath perished? And where have the upright been cut off?"
"As I have seen -- ploughers of iniquity, And sowers of misery, reap it!"
"From the breath of God they perish, And from the spirit of His anger consumed."
"The roaring of a lion, And the voice of a fierce lion, And teeth of young lions have been broken."
"An old lion is perishing without prey, And the whelps of the lioness do separate."
"And unto me a thing is secretly brought, And receive doth mine ear a little of it."
"In thoughts from visions of the night, In the falling of deep sleep on men,"
"Fear hath met me, and trembling, And the multitude of my bones caused to fear."
"And a spirit before my face doth pass, Stand up doth the hair of my flesh;"
"It standeth, and I discern not its aspect, A similitude  over-against mine eyes, Silence! and a voice I hear:"
`Is mortal man than God more righteous? Than his Maker is a man cleaner?
"Lo, in His servants He putteth no credence, Nor in His messengers setteth praise.'"
"Also -- the inhabitants of houses of clay, (Whose foundation  in the dust, They bruise them before a moth.)"
"From morning to evening are beaten down, Without any regarding, for ever they perish."
"Hath not their excellency been removed with them? They die, and not in wisdom!"
