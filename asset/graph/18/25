And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: --
"The rule and fear `are' with Him, Making peace in His high places."
Is their `any' number to His troops? And on whom ariseth not His light?
And what? is man righteous with God? And what? is he pure -- born of a woman?
"Lo -- unto the moon, and it shineth not, And stars have not been pure in His eyes."
"How much less man -- a grub, And the son of man -- a worm!"
