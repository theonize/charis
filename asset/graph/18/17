"My spirit hath been destroyed, My days extinguished -- graves `are' for me."
If not -- mockeries `are' with me. And in their provocations mine eye lodgeth.
"Place, I pray Thee, my pledge with Thee; Who is he that striketh hand with me?"
"For their heart Thou hast hidden From understanding, Therefore Thou dost not exalt them."
"For a portion he sheweth friendship, And the eyes of his sons are consumed."
"And he set me up for a proverb of the peoples, And a wonder before them I am."
"And dim from sorrow is mine eye, And my members as a shadow all of them."
"Astonished are the upright at this, And the innocent against the profane Stirreth himself up."
"And the righteous layeth hold `on' his way, And the clean of hands addeth strength, And -- dumb are they all."
"Return, and come in, I pray you, And I find not among you a wise man."
"My days have passed by, My devices have been broken off, The possessions of my heart!"
"Night for day they appoint, Light  near because of darkness."
"If I wait -- Sheol  my house, In darkness I have spread out my couch."
To corruption I have called: -- `Thou `art' my father.' `My mother' and `my sister' -- to the worm.
"And where  now my hope? Yea, my hope, who doth behold it?"
"`To' the parts of Sheol ye go down, If together on the dust we may rest."
