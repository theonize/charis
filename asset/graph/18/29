"And Job addeth to lift up his simile, and saith: --"
"Who doth make me as `in' months past, As `in' the days of God's preserving me?"
"When His lamp shone on my head, By His light I walk `through' darkness."
"As I have been in days of my maturity, And the counsel of God upon my tent."
"When yet the Mighty One  with me. Round about me -- my young ones,"
"When washing my goings with butter, And the firm rock  with me rivulets of oil."
"When I go out to the gate by the city, In a broad place I prepare my seat."
"Seen me have youths, and they, been hidden, And the aged have risen -- they stood up."
"Princes have kept in words, And a hand they place on their mouth."
"The voice of leaders hath been hidden, And their tongue to the palate hath cleaved."
"For the ear heard, and declareth me happy, And the eye hath seen, and testifieth `to' me."
"For I deliver the afflicted who is crying, And the fatherless who hath no helper."
"The blessing of the perishing cometh on me, And the heart of the widow I cause to sing."
"Righteousness I have put on, and it clotheth me, As a robe and a diadem my justice."
"Eyes I have been to the blind, And feet to the lame `am' I."
"A father I `am' to the needy, And the cause I have not known I search out."
"And I break the jaw-teeth of the perverse, And from his teeth I cast away prey."
"And I say, `With my nest I expire, And as the sand I multiply days.'"
"My root is open unto the waters, And dew doth lodge on my branch."
"My honour  fresh with me, And my bow in my hand is renewed."
"To me they have hearkened, Yea, they wait, and are silent for my counsel."
"After my word they change not, And on them doth my speech drop,"
"And they wait as `for' rain for me, And their mouth they have opened wide `As' for the latter rain."
"I laugh unto them -- they give no credence, And the light of my face cause not to fall."
"I choose their way, and sit head, And I dwell as a king in a troop, When mourners he doth comfort."
