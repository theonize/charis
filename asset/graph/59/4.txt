"Whence `are' wars and fightings among you? not thence -- out of your passions, that are as soldiers in your members?"
"ye desire, and ye have not; ye murder, and are zealous, and are not able to attain; ye fight and war, and ye have not, because of your not asking;"
"ye ask, and ye receive not, because evilly ye ask, that in your pleasures ye may spend `it'."
"Adulterers and adulteresses! have ye not known that friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever, then, may counsel to be a friend of the world, an enemy of God he is set."
"Do ye think that emptily the Writing saith, `To envy earnestly desireth the spirit that did dwell in us,'"
"and greater grace he doth give, wherefore he saith, `God against proud ones doth set Himself up, and to lowly ones He doth give grace?'"
"be subject, then, to God; stand up against the devil, and he will flee from you;"
"draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you; cleanse hands, ye sinners! and purify hearts, ye double-minded!"
"be exceeding afflicted, and mourn, and weep, let your laughter to mourning be turned, and the joy to heaviness;"
"be made low before the Lord, and He shall exalt you."
"Speak not one against another, brethren; he who is speaking against a brother, and is judging his brother, doth speak against law, and doth judge law, and if law thou dost judge, thou art not a doer of law but a judge;"
"one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy; thou -- who art thou that dost judge the other?"
"Go, now, ye who are saying, `To-day and to-morrow we will go on to such a city, and will pass there one year, and traffic, and make gain;'"
"who do not know the thing of the morrow; for what is your life? for it is a vapour that is appearing for a little, and then is vanishing;"
"instead of your saying, `If the Lord may will, we shall live, and do this or that;'"
and now ye glory in your pride; all such glorying is evil;
"to him, then, knowing to do good, and not doing, sin it is to him."
