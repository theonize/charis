"and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah unto the further sea,"

"in reference to all the signs and the wonders which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,"
"and in reference to all the strong hand, and to all the great fear which Moses did before the eyes of all Israel."
