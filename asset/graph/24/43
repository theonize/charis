"And it cometh to pass, when Jeremiah doth finish to speak unto all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, with which Yahweh their God hath sent him unto them -- all these words --"
"that Azariah son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan son of Kareah, and all the proud men, speak unto Jeremiah, saying, `Falsehood thou art speaking; Yahweh our God hath not sent thee to say, Do not enter Egypt to sojourn there;"
"for Baruch son of Neriah is moving thee against us, in order to give us up into the hand of the Chaldeans, to put us to death, and to remove us to Babylon.'"
"And Johanan son of Kareah, and all the heads of the forces, and all the people, have not hearkened to the voice of Yahweh, to dwell in the land of Judah;"
"and Johanan son of Kareah, and all the heads of the forces, take all the remnant of Judah who have turned from all the nations whither they were driven to sojourn in the land of Judah,"
"the men, and the women, and the infant, and the daughters of the king, and every person that Nebuzar-Adan, chief of the executioners, had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch son of Neriah,"
"and they enter the land of Egypt, for they have not hearkened to the voice of Yahweh, and they enter unto Tahpanhes."
"And there is a word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,"
"`Take in thy hand great stones, and thou hast hidden them, in the clay, in the brick-kiln, that  at the opening of the house of Pharaoh in Tahpanhes, before the eyes of the men of Judah,"
"and thou hast said unto them: Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: `Lo, I am sending, and I have taken Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and I have set his throne above these stones that I have hid, and he hath stretched out his pavilion over them,"
"and he hath come, and smitten the land of Egypt -- those who `are' for death to death, and those who `are' for captivity to captivity, and those who `are' for the sword to the sword."
"And I have kindled a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and it hath burned them, and he hath taken them captive, and covered himself with the land of Egypt, as cover himself doth the shepherd with his garment, and he hath gone forth thence in peace;"
"and he hath broken the standing pillars of the house of the sun, that  in the land of Egypt, and the houses of the gods of Egypt he doth burn with fire.'"
