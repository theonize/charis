"And Abijah lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David, and reign doth Asa his son in his stead: in his days was the land quiet ten years."
"And Asa doth that which is good, and that which is right, in the eyes of Yahweh his God,"
"and turneth aside the altars of the stranger, and the high places, and breaketh the standing-pillars, and cutteth down the shrines,"
"and saith to Judah to seek Yahweh, God of their fathers, and to do the law and the command;"
"and he turneth aside out of all cities of Judah the high places and the images, and the kingdom is quiet before him."
"And he buildeth cities of bulwarks in Judah, for the land hath quiet, and there is no war with him in these years, because Yahweh hath given rest to him."
"And he saith to Judah, `Let us build these cities, and compass `them' with wall, and towers, two-leaved doors, and bars, while the land  before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God, we have sought, and He giveth rest to us round about;' and they build and prosper."
"And there is to Asa a force bearing target and spear, out of Judah three hundred thousand, and out of Benjamin, bearing shield and treading bow, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these `are' mighty of valour."
"And come out unto them doth Zerah the Cushite with a force of a thousand thousand, and chariots three hundred, and he cometh in unto Mareshah,"
"and Asa goeth out before him, and they set battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah."
"And Asa calleth unto Yahweh his God, and saith, `Yahweh! it is nothing with Thee to help, between the mighty and those who have no power; help us, O Yahweh, our God, for on Thee we have leant, and in Thy name we have come against this multitude; O Yahweh, our God thou `art'; let him not prevail with Thee -- mortal man!"
"And Yahweh smiteth the Cushim before Asa, and before Judah, and the Cushim flee,"
"and Asa and the people who `are' with him pursue them even to Gerar, and there fall of the Cushim, for they have no preserving, because they have been broken before Yahweh, and before His camp; and they bear away very much spoil,"
"and smite all the cities round about Gerar, for a fear of Yahweh hath been upon them, and they spoil all the cities, for abundant spoil hath been in them;"
"and also tents of cattle they have smitten, and they capture sheep in abundance, and camels, and turn back to Jerusalem."
