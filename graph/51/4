"praying at the same time also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the secret of the Christ, because of which also I have been bound,"
"that I may manifest it, as it behoveth me to speak;"

"with Onesimus the faithful and beloved brother, who is of you; all things to you shall they make known that `are' here."

"Salute you doth Epaphras, who  of you, a servant of Christ, always striving for you in the prayers, that ye may stand perfect and made full in all the will of God,"

"Salute you doth Lukas, the beloved physician, and Demas;"

"and when the epistle may be read with you, cause that also in the assembly of the Laodiceans it may be read, and the `epistle' from Laodicea that ye also may read;"
"and say to Archippus, `See to the ministration that thou didst receive in the Lord, that thou mayest fulfil it.'"
"The salutation by the hand of me, Paul; remember my bonds; the grace  with you. Amen."
