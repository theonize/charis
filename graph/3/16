"And Yahweh speaketh unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, in their drawing near before Yahweh, and they die;"
"yea, Yahweh saith unto Moses, `Speak unto Aaron thy brother, and he cometh not in at all times unto the sanctuary within the vail, unto the front of the mercy-seat, which  upon the ark, and he dieth not, for in a cloud I am seen upon the mercy-seat."
"`With this doth Aaron come in unto the sanctuary; with a bullock, a son of the herd, for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering;"
"a holy linen coat he putteth on, and linen trousers are on his flesh, and with a linen girdle he girdeth himself, and with a linen mitre he wrappeth himself up; they `are' holy garments; and he hath bathed with water his flesh, and hath put them on."
"`And from the company of the sons of Israel he taketh two kids of the goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering;"
"and Aaron hath brought near the bullock of the sin-offering which is his own, and hath made atonement for himself, and for his house;"
"and he hath taken the two goats, and hath caused them to stand before Yahweh, at the opening of the tent of meeting."
"`And Aaron hath given lots over the two goats, one lot for Yahweh, and one lot for a goat of departure;"
"and Aaron hath brought near the goat on which the lot for Yahweh hath gone up, and hath made it a sin-offering."
"`And the goat on which the lot for a goat of departure hath gone up is caused to stand living before Yahweh to make atonement by it, to send it away for a goat of departure into the wilderness."
"`And Aaron hath brought near the bullock of the sin-offering which is his own, and hath made atonement for himself, and for his house, and hath slaughtered the bullock of the sin-offering which  his own,"
"and hath taken the fulness of the censer of burning coals of fire from off the altar, from before Yahweh, and the fulness of his hands of thin spice-perfume, and hath brought `it' within the vail;"
"and he hath put the perfume on the fire before Yahweh, and the cloud of the perfume hath covered the mercy-seat which  on the testimony, and he dieth not."
"`And he hath taken of the blood of the bullock, and hath sprinkled with his finger on the front of the mercy-seat eastward; even at the front of the mercy-seat he doth sprinkle seven times of the blood with his finger."
"`And he hath slaughtered the goat of the sin-offering which  the people's, and hath brought in its blood unto the inside of the vail, and hath done with its blood as he hath done with the blood of the bullock, and hath sprinkled it on the mercy-seat, and at the front of the mercy-seat,"
"and he hath made atonement for the sanctuary because of the uncleanness of the sons of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins; and so he doth for the tent of meeting which is tabernacling with them in the midst of their uncleannesses."
"`And no man is in the tent of meeting in his going in to make atonement in the sanctuary, till his coming out; and he hath made atonement for himself, and for his house, and for all the assembly of Israel."
"`And he hath gone out unto the altar which  before Yahweh, and hath made atonement for it; and he hath taken of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and hath put on the horns of the altar round about;"
"and he hath sprinkled on it of the blood with his finger seven times, and hath cleansed it, and hath hallowed it from the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel."
"`And he hath ceased from making atonement `for' the sanctuary, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, and hath brought near the living goat;"
"and Aaron hath laid his two hands on the head of the living goat, and hath confessed over it all the iniquities of the sons of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, and hath put them on the head of the goat, and hath sent `it' away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness;"
"and the goat hath borne on him all their iniquities unto a land of separation. `And he hath sent the goat away into the wilderness,"
"and Aaron hath come in unto the tent of meeting, and hath stripped off the linen garments which he had put on in his going in unto the sanctuary, and hath placed them there;"
"and he hath bathed his flesh with water in the holy place, and hath put on his garments, and hath come out, and hath made his burnt-offering, and the burnt-offering of the people, and hath made atonement for himself and for the people;"
and with the fat of the sin-offering he doth make perfume on the altar.
"`And he who is sending away the goat for a goat of departure doth wash his garments, and hath bathed his flesh with water, and afterwards he cometh in unto the camp."
"`And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood hath been brought in to make atonement in the sanctuary, doth `one' bring out unto the outside of the camp, and they have burnt with fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung;"
"and he who is burning them doth wash his garments, and hath bathed his flesh with water, and afterwards he cometh in unto the camp."
"`And it hath been to you for a statute age-during, in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month, ye humble yourselves, and do no work -- the native, and the sojourner who is sojourning in your midst;"
"for on this day he maketh atonement for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins before Yahweh ye are clean;"
"it  to you a sabbath of rest, and ye have humbled yourselves -- a statute age-during."
"`And the priest whom he doth anoint, and whose hand he doth consecrate to act as priest instead of his father, hath made atonement, and hath put on the linen garments, the holy garments;"
"and he hath made atonement `for' the holy sanctuary; and `for' the tent of meeting, even `for' the altar he doth make atonement; yea, for the priests, and for all the people of the assembly he maketh atonement."
"`And this hath been to you for a statute age-during, to make atonement for the sons of Israel, because of all their sins, once in a year;' and he doth as Yahweh hath commanded Moses."
