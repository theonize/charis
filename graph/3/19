"`Ye do not do perversity in judgment; thou dost not lift up the face of the poor, nor honour the face of the great; in righteousness thou dost judge thy fellow."
`Thou dost not go slandering among thy people; thou dost not stand against the blood of thy neighbour; I `am' Yahweh.
"`Thou dost not hate thy brother in thy heart; thou dost certainly reprove thy fellow, and not suffer sin on him."
"`Thou dost not take vengeance, nor watch the sons of thy people; and thou hast had love to thy neighbour as thyself; I `am' Yahweh."
"`My statutes ye do keep: thy cattle thou dost not cause to gender `with' diverse kinds; thy field thou dost not sow with diverse kinds, and a garment of diverse kinds, shaatnez, doth not go up upon thee."
"`And when a man lieth with a woman with seed of copulation, and she a maid-servant, betrothed to a man, and not really ransomed, or freedom hath not been given to her, an investigation there is; they are not put to death, for she  not free."
"`And he hath brought in his guilt-offering to Yahweh, unto the opening of the tent of meeting, a ram `for' a guilt-offering,"
"and the priest hath made atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering before Yahweh, for his sin which he hath sinned, and it hath been forgiven him because of his sin which he hath sinned."
"`And when ye come in unto the land, and have planted all `kinds' of trees `for' food, then ye have reckoned as uncircumcised its fruit, three years it is to you uncircumcised, it is not eaten,"
and in the fourth year all its fruit is holy -- praises for Yahweh.
And in the fifth year ye do eat its fruit -- to add to you its increase; I `am' Yahweh your God.
"`Ye do not eat with the blood; ye do not enchant, nor observe clouds."

"as a native among you is the sojourner to you who is sojourning with you, and thou hast had love to him as to thyself, for sojourners ye have been in the land of Egypt; I `am' Yahweh your God."
"`Ye do not do perversity in judgment, in mete-yard, in weight, or in liquid measure;"
"righteous balances, righteous weights, a righteous ephah, and a righteous hin ye have; I `am' Yahweh your God, who hath brought you out from the land of Egypt;"
"and ye have observed all my statutes, and all my judgments, and have done them; I `am' Yahweh.'"
