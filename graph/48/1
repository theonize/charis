"Paul, an apostle -- not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who did raise him out of the dead --"
"and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:"
"Grace to you, and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,"
"who did give himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of the present evil age, according to the will of God even our Father,"
to whom  the glory to the ages of the ages. Amen.
I wonder that ye are so quickly removed from Him who did call you in the grace of Christ to another good news;
"that is not another, except there be certain who are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of the Christ;"
but even if we or a messenger out of heaven may proclaim good news to you different from what we did proclaim to you -- anathema let him be!
"as we have said before, and now say again, If any one to you may proclaim good news different from what ye did receive -- anathema let him be!"
"for now men do I persuade, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if yet men I did please -- Christ's servant I should not be."
"And I make known to you, brethren, the good news that were proclaimed by me, that it is not according to man,"
"for neither did I from man receive it, nor was I taught `it', but through a revelation of Jesus Christ,"
"for ye did hear of my behaviour once in Judaism, that exceedingly I was persecuting the assembly of God, and wasting it,"
"and I was advancing in Judaism above many equals in age in mine own race, being more abundantly zealous of my fathers' deliverances,"
"and when God was well pleased -- having separated me from the womb of my mother, and having called `me' through His grace --"
"to reveal His Son in me, that I might proclaim him good news among the nations, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood,"
"nor did I go up to Jerusalem unto those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus,"
"then, after three years I went up to Jerusalem to enquire about Peter, and remained with him fifteen days,"
"and other of the apostles I did not see, except James, the brother of the Lord."
"And the things that I write to you, lo, before God -- I lie not;"
"then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,"
"and was unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea, that `are' in Christ,"
"and only they were hearing, that `he who is persecuting us then, doth now proclaim good news -- the faith that then he was wasting;'"
and they were glorifying God in me.
