"`And it hath been, when thou comest in unto the land which Yahweh thy God is giving to thee -- an inheritance, and thou hast possessed it, and dwelt in it,"
"that thou hast taken of firstfruits of the ground which thou dost bring in out of thy land which Yahweh thy God is giving to thee, and hast put `it' in a basket, and gone unto the place which Yahweh thy God doth choose to cause His name to tabernacle there."
"`And thou hast come in unto the priest who is in those days, and hast said unto him, I have declared to-day to Yahweh thy God, that I have come in unto the land which Yahweh hath sworn to our fathers to give to us;"
"and the priest hath taken the basket out of thy hand, and placed it before the altar of Yahweh thy God."
"`And thou hast answered and said before Yahweh thy God, A perishing Aramaean  my father! and he goeth down to Egypt, and sojourneth there with few men, and becometh there a nation, great, mighty, and numerous;"
"and the Egyptians do us evil, and afflict us, and put on us hard service;"
"and we cry unto Yahweh, God of our fathers, and Yahweh heareth our voice, and seeth our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression;"
"and Yahweh bringeth us out from Egypt, by a strong hand, and by a stretched-out arm, and by great fear, and by signs, and by wonders,"
"and he bringeth us in unto this place, and giveth to us this land -- a land flowing with milk and honey."
"`And now, lo, I have brought in the firstfruits of the ground which thou hast given to me, O Yahweh; -- and thou hast placed it before Yahweh thy God, and bowed thyself before Yahweh thy God,"
"and rejoiced in all the good which Yahweh thy God hath given to thee, and to thy house, thou, and the Levite, and the sojourner who  in thy midst."
"`When thou dost complete to tithe all the tithe of thine increase in the third year, the year of the tithe, then thou hast given to the Levite, to the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, and they have eaten within thy gates, and been satisfied,"
"and thou hast said before Yahweh thy God, I have put away the separated thing out of the house, and also have given it to the Levite, and to the sojourner, and to the orphan, and to the widow, according to all Thy command which Thou hast commanded me; I have not passed over from Thy commands, nor have I forgotten."
"I have not eaten in mine affliction of it, nor have I put away of it for uncleanness, nor have I given of it for the dead; I have hearkened to the voice of Yahweh my God; I have done according to all that Thou hast commanded me;"
"look from Thy holy habitation, from the heavens, and bless Thy people Israel, and the ground which Thou hast given to us, as Thou hast sworn to our fathers -- a land flowing `with' milk and honey."
"`This day Yahweh thy God is commanding thee to do these statutes and judgments; and thou hast hearkened and done them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,"
"Yahweh thou hast caused to promise to-day to become thy God, and to walk in His ways, and to keep His statutes, and His commands, and His judgments, and to hearken to His voice."
"`And Yahweh hath caused thee to promise to-day to become His people, a peculiar treasure, as He hath spoken to thee, and to keep all His commands;"
"so as to make thee uppermost above all the nations whom He hath made for a praise, and for a name, and for beauty, and for thy being a holy people to Yahweh thy God, as He hath spoken."
