"In the year of the coming in of Tartan to Ashdod, when Sargon king of Asshur sendeth him, and he fighteth against Ashdod, and captureth it,"
"at that time spake Yahweh by the hand of Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, `Go, and thou hast loosed the sackcloth from off thy loins, and thy sandal thou dost draw from off thy foot,' and he doth so, going naked and barefoot."
"And Yahweh saith, `As My servant Isaiah hath gone naked and barefoot three years, a sign and a wonder for Egypt and for Cush,"
"so doth the king of Asshur lead the captivity of Egypt, and the removal of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, with seat uncovered -- the nakedness of Egypt;"
"and they have been affrighted and ashamed of Cush their confidence, and of Egypt their beauty,"
"and the inhabitant of this isle hath said in that day -- Lo, thus  our trust, Whither we have fled for help, To be delivered from the king of Asshur, And how do we escape -- we?'"
