"It is not said of thee any more, `Forsaken!' And of thy land it is not said any more, `Desolate,' For to thee is cried, `My delight  in her,' And to thy land, `Married,' For Yahweh hath delighted in thee, And thy land is married."
"For a young man doth marry a virgin, Thy Builders do marry thee, With the joy of a bridegroom over a bride, Rejoice over thee doth thy God."
"`On thy walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen, All the day, and all the night, Continually, they are not silent.' O ye remembrancers of Yahweh, Keep not silence for yourselves,"

"And they have cried to them, `People of the Holy One, Redeemed of Yahweh,' Yea, to thee is called, `Sought out one, a city not forsaken!'"
