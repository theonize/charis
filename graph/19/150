"Praise ye Jah! Praise ye God in His holy place, Praise Him in the expanse of His strength."
"Praise Him in His mighty acts, Praise Him according to the abundance of His greatness."
"Praise Him with blowing of trumpet, Praise Him with psaltery and harp."
"Praise Him with timbrel and dance, Praise Him with stringed instruments and organ."
"Praise Him with cymbals of sounding, Praise Him with cymbals of shouting."
All that doth breathe doth praise Jah! Praise ye Jah!
