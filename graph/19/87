"By sons of Korah. -- A Psalm, a song. His foundation  in holy mountains."
Yahweh is loving the gates of Zion Above all the tabernacles of Jacob.
"Honourable things are spoken in Thee, O city of God. Selah."
"I mention Rahab and Babel to those knowing Me, Lo, Philistia, and Tyre, with Cush! This `one' was born there."
"And of Zion it is said: Each one was born in her, And He, the Most High, doth establish her."
"Yahweh doth recount in the describing of the peoples, `This `one' was born there.' Selah."
"Singers also as players on instruments, All my fountains `are' in Thee!"
