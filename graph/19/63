"A Psalm of David, in his being in the wilderness of Judah. O God, Thou `art' my God, earnestly do I seek Thee, Thirsted for Thee hath my soul, Longed for Thee hath my flesh, In a land dry and weary, without waters."
"So in the sanctuary I have seen Thee, To behold Thy strength and Thine honour."
"Because better  Thy kindness than life, My lips do praise Thee."
"So I bless Thee in my life, in Thy name I lift up my hands."
"As `with' milk and fatness is my soul satisfied, And `with' singing lips doth my mouth praise."
"If I have remembered Thee on my couch, In the watches -- I meditate on Thee."
"For Thou hast been a help to me, And in the shadow of Thy wings I sing."
"Cleaved hath my soul after Thee, On me hath Thy right hand taken hold."
"And they who for desolation seek my soul, Go in to the lower parts of the earth."
"They cause him to run on the edge of the sword, A portion for foxes they are."
"And the king doth rejoice in God, Boast himself doth every one swearing by Him, But stopped is the mouth of those speaking lies!"
