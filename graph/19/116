"I have loved, because Yahweh heareth My voice, my supplication,"
"Because He hath inclined His ear to me, And during my days I call."
"Compassed me have cords of death, And straits of Sheol have found me, Distress and sorrow I find."
"And in the name of Yahweh I call: I pray Thee, O Yahweh, deliver my soul,"
"Gracious  Yahweh, and righteous, Yea, our God  merciful,"
"A preserver of the simple  Yahweh, I was low, and to me He giveth salvation."
"Turn back, O my soul, to thy rest, For Yahweh hath conferred benefits on thee."
"For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, My eyes from tears, my feet from overthrowing."
I walk habitually before Yahweh In the lands of the living.
"I have believed, for I speak, I -- I have been afflicted greatly."
"I said in my haste, `Every man  a liar.'"
What do I return to Yahweh? All His benefits `are' upon me.
"The cup of salvation I lift up, And in the name of Yahweh I call."
"My vows to Yahweh let me complete, I pray you, before all His people."
Precious in the eyes of Yahweh  the death for His saints.
"Cause `it' to come, O Yahweh, for I `am' Thy servant. I `am' Thy servant, son of Thy handmaid, Thou hast opened my bonds."
"To Thee I sacrifice a sacrifice of thanks, And in the name of Yahweh I call."
"My vows to Yahweh let me complete, I pray you, before all His people,"
"In the courts of the house of Yahweh, In thy midst, O Jerusalem, praise ye Jah!"
