"A Psalm of Thanksgiving. Shout to Yahweh, all the earth."
"Serve Yahweh with joy, come before him with singing."
"Know that Yahweh He  God, He made us, and we are His, His people -- and the flock of His pasture."
"Enter ye His gates with thanksgiving, His courts with praise, Give ye thanks to Him, bless ye His Name."
"For good  Yahweh, to the age His kindness, And to generation and generation His faithfulness!"
