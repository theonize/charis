"A Song of the Ascents. From depths I have called Thee, Yahweh."
"Lord, hearken to my voice, Thine ears are attentive to the voice of my supplications."
"If iniquities Thou dost observe, O Lord, who doth stand?"
"But with Thee  forgiveness, that Thou mayest be feared."
"I hoped `for' Yahweh -- hoped hath my soul, And for His word I have waited."
"My soul  for the Lord, More than those watching for morning, Watching for morning!"
"Israel doth wait on Yahweh, For with Yahweh  kindness, And abundant with Him  redemption."
And He doth redeem Israel from all his iniquities!
