"A Song of the Ascents. Remember, Yahweh, for David, all his afflictions."
Who hath sworn to Yahweh. He hath vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
"`If I enter into the tent of my house, If I go up on the couch of my bed,"
"If I give sleep to mine eyes, To mine eyelids -- slumber,"
"Till I do find a place for Yahweh, Tabernacles for the Mighty One of Jacob."
"`Lo, we have heard it in Ephratah, We have found it in the fields of the forest."
"We come in to His tabernacles, We bow ourselves at His footstool."
"Arise, O Yahweh, to Thy rest, Thou, and the ark of Thy strength,"
"Thy priests do put on righteousness, And Thy pious ones cry aloud."
"For the sake of David Thy servant, Turn not back the face of Thine anointed."
"Yahweh hath sworn truth to David, He turneth not back from it: Of the fruit of thy body, I set on the throne for thee."
"If thy sons keep My covenant, And My testimonies that I teach them, Their sons also for ever and ever, Do sit on the throne for thee."
"For Yahweh hath fixed on Zion, He hath desired `it' for a seat to Himself,"
"This  My rest for ever and ever, Here do I sit, for I have desired it."
"Her provision I greatly bless, Her needy ones I satisfy `with' bread,"
"And her priests I clothe `with' salvation, And her pious ones do sing aloud."
"There I cause to spring up a horn for David, I have arranged a lamp for Mine anointed."
"His enemies I do clothe `with' shame, And upon him doth his crown flourish!"
