"A Secret Treasure of David. Preserve me, O God, for I did trust in Thee."
"Thou hast said to Yahweh, `My Lord Thou `art';' My good  not for thine own sake;"
"For the holy ones who `are' in the land, And the honourable, all my delight  in them."
"Multiplied are their griefs, `Who' have hastened backward; I pour not out their libations of blood, Nor do I take up their names on my lips."
"Yahweh  the portion of my share, and of my cup, Thou -- Thou dost uphold my lot."
"Lines have fallen to me in pleasant places, Yea, a beauteous inheritance  for me."
I bless Yahweh who hath counselled me; Also `in' the nights my reins instruct me.
"I did place Yahweh before me continually, Because -- at my right hand I am not moved."
"Therefore hath my heart been glad, And my honour doth rejoice, Also my flesh dwelleth confidently:"
"For Thou dost not leave my soul to Sheol, Nor givest thy saintly one to see corruption."
"Thou causest me to know the path of life; Fulness of joys  with Thy presence, Pleasant things by Thy right hand for ever!"
