"A Song of the Ascents. Unto Thee I have lifted up mine eyes, O dweller in the heavens."
"Lo, as eyes of men-servants `Are' unto the hand of their masters, As eyes of a maid-servant `Are' unto the hand of her mistress, So `are' our eyes unto Yahweh our God, Till that He doth favour us."
"Favour us, O Yahweh, favour us, For greatly have we been filled with contempt,"
"Greatly hath our soul been filled With the scorning of the easy ones, With the contempt of the arrogant!"
