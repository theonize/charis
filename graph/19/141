"A Psalm, by David. O Yahweh, I have called Thee, haste to me, Give ear `to' my voice when I call to Thee."
"My prayer is prepared -- incense before Thee, The lifting up of my hands -- the evening present."
"Set, O Yahweh, a watch for my mouth, Watch Thou over the door of my lips."
"Incline not my heart to an evil thing, To do habitually actions in wickedness, With men working iniquity, Yea, I eat not of their pleasant things."
"The righteous doth beat me `in' kindness. And doth reprove me, Oil of the head my head disalloweth not, For still my prayer  about their vexations."
"Their judges have been released by the sides of a rock, And they have heard my sayings, For they have been pleasant."
"As one tilling and ripping up in the land, Have our bones been scattered at the mouth of Sheol."
"But to Thee, O Yahweh, my Lord, `are' mine eyes, In Thee I have trusted, Make not bare my soul."
"Keep me from the gin they laid for me, Even snares of workers of iniquity."
"The wicked fall in their nets together, till I pass over!"
