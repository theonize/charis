"An Instruction of David, a Prayer when he is in the cave. My voice  unto Yahweh, I cry, My voice  unto Yahweh, I entreat grace."
"I pour forth before Him my meditation, My distress before Him I declare."
"When my spirit hath been feeble in me, Then Thou hast known my path; In the way `in' which I walk, They have hid a snare for me."
"Looking on the right hand -- and seeing, And I have none recognizing; Perished hath refuge from me, There is none inquiring for my soul."
"I have cried unto thee, O Yahweh, I have said, `Thou `art' my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.'"
"Attend Thou unto my loud cry, For I have become very low, Deliver Thou me from my pursuers, For they have been stronger than I."
"Bring forth from prison my soul to confess Thy name, The righteous do compass me about, When Thou conferrest benefits upon me!"
