"A Psalm of David. Yahweh  my shepherd, I do not lack,"
"In pastures of tender grass He causeth me to lie down, By quiet waters He doth lead me."
"My soul He refresheth, He leadeth me in paths of righteousness, For His name's sake,"
"Also -- when I walk in a valley of death-shade, I fear no evil, for Thou `art' with me, Thy rod and Thy staff -- they comfort me."
"Thou arrangest before me a table, Over-against my adversaries, Thou hast anointed with oil my head, My cup is full!"
"Only -- goodness and kindness pursue me, All the days of my life, And my dwelling  in the house of Yahweh, For a length of days!"
