"To the Overseer, on stringed instruments. -- By David. Hear, O God, my loud cry, attend to my prayer."
"From the end of the land unto Thee I call, In the feebleness of my heart, Into a rock higher than I Thou dost lead me."
"For Thou hast been a refuge for me, A tower of strength because of the enemy."
"I sojourn in Thy tent to the ages, I trust in the secret place of Thy wings. Selah."
"For Thou, O God, hast hearkened to my vows, Thou hast appointed the inheritance Of those fearing Thy name."
"Days to the days of the king Thou addest, His years as generation and generation."
"He dwelleth to the age before God, Kindness and truth appoint -- they keep him."
"So do I praise Thy name for ever, When I pay my vows day by day!"
