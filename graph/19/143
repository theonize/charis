"A Psalm of David. O Yahweh, hear my prayer, Give ear unto my supplications, In Thy faithfulness answer me -- in Thy righteousness."
"And enter not into judgment with Thy servant, For no one living is justified before Thee."
"For an enemy hath pursued my soul, He hath bruised to the earth my life, He hath caused me to dwell in dark places, As the dead of old."
"And my spirit in me is become feeble, Within me is my heart become desolate."
"I have remembered days of old, I have meditated on all Thine acts, On the work of Thy hand I muse."
"I have spread forth my hands unto Thee, My soul  as a weary land for Thee. Selah."
"Haste, answer me, O Yahweh, My spirit hath been consumed, Hide not Thou Thy face from me, Or I have been compared with those going down `to' the pit."
"Cause me to hear in the morning Thy kindness, For in Thee I have trusted, Cause me to know the way that I go, For unto Thee I have lifted up my soul."
"Deliver me from mine enemies, O Yahweh, Near Thee I am covered."
"Teach me to do Thy good pleasure, For Thou `art' my God -- Thy Spirit  good, Lead me into a land of uprightness."
"For Thy name's sake O Yahweh, Thou dost quicken me, In Thy righteousness, Thou bringest out from distress my soul,"
"And in Thy kindness cuttest off mine enemies, And hast destroyed all the adversaries of my soul, For I `am' Thy servant!"
