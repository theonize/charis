"To the Overseer. -- A Psalm of David, in the coming inn unto him of Nathan the prophet, when he hath gone in unto Bath-Sheba. Favour me, O God, according to Thy kindness, According to the abundance of Thy mercies, Blot out my transgressions."
"Thoroughly wash me from mine iniquity, And from my sin cleanse me,"
"For my transgressions I do know, And my sin  before me continually."
"Against Thee, Thee only, I have sinned, And done the evil thing in Thine eyes, So that Thou art righteous in Thy words, Thou art pure in Thy judging."
"Lo, in iniquity I have been brought forth, And in sin doth my mother conceive me."
"Lo, truth Thou hast desired in the inward parts, And in the hidden part Wisdom Thou causest me to know."
"Thou cleansest me with hyssop and I am clean, Washest me, and than snow I am whiter."
"Thou causest me to hear joy and gladness, Thou makest joyful bones Thou hast bruised."
Hide Thy face from my sin. And all mine iniquities blot out.
"A clean heart prepare for me, O God, And a right spirit renew within me."
"Cast me not forth from Thy presence, And Thy Holy Spirit take not from me."
"Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation, And a willing spirit doth sustain me."
"I teach transgressors Thy ways, And sinners unto Thee do return."
"Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation, My tongue singeth of Thy righteousness."
"O Lord, my lips thou dost open, And my mouth declareth Thy praise."
"For Thou desirest not sacrifice, or I give `it', Burnt-offering Thou acceptest not."
"The sacrifices of God `are' a broken spirit, A heart broken and bruised, O God, Thou dost not despise."
"Do good in Thy good pleasure with Zion, Thou dost build the walls of Jerusalem."
"Then Thou desirest sacrifices of righteousness, Burnt-offering, and whole burnt-offering, Then they offer bullocks on thine altar!"
