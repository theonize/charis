"Why, Yahweh, dost Thou stand at a distance? Thou dost hide in times of adversity,"
"Through the pride of the wicked, Is the poor inflamed, They are caught in devices that they devised."
"Because the wicked hath boasted Of the desire of his soul, And a dishonest gainer he hath blessed, He hath despised Yahweh."
"The wicked according to the height of his face, inquireth not. `God is not!' `are' all his devices."
"Pain do his ways at all times, On high `are' Thy judgments before him, All his adversaries -- he puffeth at them."
"He hath said in his heart, `I am not moved,' To generation and generation not in evil."
"Of oaths his mouth is full, And deceits, and fraud: Under his tongue  perverseness and iniquity,"
"He doth sit in an ambush of the villages, In secret places he doth slay the innocent. His eyes for the afflicted watch secretly,"
"He lieth in wait in a secret place, as a lion in a covert. He lieth in wait to catch the poor, He catcheth the poor, drawing him into his net."
"He is bruised -- he boweth down, Fallen by his mighty ones hath the afflicted."
"He said in his heart, `God hath forgotten, He hath hid His face, He hath never seen.'"
"Arise, O Yahweh! O God, lift up Thy hand! Forget not the humble."
"Wherefore hath the wicked despised God? He hath said in his heart, `It is not required.'"
"Thou hast seen, For Thou perverseness and anger beholdest; By giving into Thy hand, On Thee doth the afflicted leave `it', Of the fatherless Thou hast been an helper."
"Break the arm of the wicked and the evil, Seek out his wickedness, find none;"
"Yahweh  king to the age, and for ever, The nations have perished out of His land!"
"The desire of the humble Thou hast heard, O Yahweh. Thou preparest their heart; Thou causest Thine ear to attend,"
To judge the fatherless and bruised: He addeth no more to oppress -- man of the earth!
