"Praise ye Jah! Sing ye to Yahweh a new song, His praise in an assembly of saints."
"Israel doth rejoice in his Maker, Sons of Zion do joy in their king."
"They praise His name in a dance, With timbrel and harp sing praise to Him."
"For Yahweh is pleased with His people, He beautifieth the humble with salvation."
"Exult do saints in honour, They sing aloud on their beds."
"The exaltation of God  in their throat, And a two-edged sword in their hand."
"To do vengeance among nations, Punishments among the peoples."
"To bind their kings with chains, And their honoured ones with fetters of iron,"
"To do among them the judgment written, An honour it  for all his saints. Praise ye Jah!"
