"To the Overseer, to Jeduthun. -- A Psalm of David. I have said, `I observe my ways, Against sinning with my tongue, I keep for my mouth a curb, while the wicked  before me.'"
"I was dumb `with' silence, I kept silent from good, and my pain is excited."
"Hot  my heart within me, In my meditating doth the fire burn, I have spoken with my tongue."
"`Cause me to know, O Yahweh, mine end, And the measure of my days -- what it ,' I know how frail I `am'."
"Lo, handbreadths Thou hast made my days, And mine age  as nothing before Thee, Only, all vanity  every man set up. Selah."
"Only, in an image doth each walk habitually, Only, `in' vain, they are disquieted, He heapeth up and knoweth not who gathereth them."
"And, now, what have I expected? O Lord, my hope -- it  of Thee."
"From all my transgressions deliver me, A reproach of the fool make me not."
"I have been dumb, I open not my mouth, Because Thou -- Thou hast done `it'."
"Turn aside from off me Thy stroke, From the striving of Thy hand I have been consumed."
"With reproofs against iniquity, Thou hast corrected man, And dost waste as a moth his desirableness, Only, vanity  every man. Selah."
"Hear my prayer, O Yahweh, And `to' my cry give ear, Unto my tear be not silent, For a sojourner I `am' with Thee, A settler like all my fathers."
"Look from me, and I brighten up before I go and am not!"
