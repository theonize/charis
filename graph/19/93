"Yahweh hath reigned, Excellency He hath put on, Yahweh put on strength, He girded Himself, Also -- established is the world, unmoved."
"Established is Thy throne since then, From the age Thou `art'."
"Floods have lifted up, O Yahweh, Floods have lifted up their voice, Floods lift up their breakers."
"Than the voices of many mighty waters, Breakers of a sea, mighty on high  Yahweh,"
"Thy testimonies have been very stedfast, To Thy house comely  holiness, O Yahweh, for length of days!"
