"To the Overseer, `On the Gittith.' A Psalm of David. Yahweh, our Lord, How honourable Thy name in all the earth! Who settest thine honour on the heavens."
"From the mouths of infants and sucklings Thou hast founded strength, Because of Thine adversaries, To still an enemy and a self-avenger."
"For I see Thy heavens, a work of Thy fingers, Moon and stars that Thou didst establish."
What  man that Thou rememberest him? The son of man that Thou inspectest him?
"And causest him to lack a little of Godhead, And with honour and majesty compassest him."
"Thou dost cause him to rule Over the works of Thy hands, All Thou hast placed under his feet."
"Sheep and oxen, all of them, And also beasts of the field,"
"Bird of the heavens, and fish of the sea, Passing through the paths of the seas!"
"Yahweh, our Lord, How honourable Thy name in all the earth!"
