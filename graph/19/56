"To the Overseer. -- `On the Dumb Dove far off.' -- A secret treasure of David, in the Philistines' taking hold of him in Gath. Favour me, O God, for man swallowed me up, All the day fighting he oppresseth me,"
"Mine enemies have swallowed up all the day, For many `are' fighting against me, O most High,"
The day I am afraid I am confident toward Thee.
"In God I praise His word, in God I have trusted, I fear not what flesh doth to me."
"All the day they wrest my words, Concerning me all their thoughts `are' for evil,"
"They assemble, they hide, they watch my heels, When they have expected my soul."
"By iniquity they escape, In anger the peoples put down, O God."
"My wandering Thou hast counted, Thou -- place Thou my tear in Thy bottle, Are they not in Thy book?"
"Then turn back do mine enemies in the day I call. This I have known, that God  for me."
"In God I praise the word, In Yahweh I praise the word."
"In God I trusted, I fear not what man doth to me,"
"On me, O God, `are' Thy vows, I repay thank-offerings to Thee."
"For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, Dost Thou not my feet from falling? To walk habitually before God in the light of the living!"
