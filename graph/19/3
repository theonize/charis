"A Psalm of David, in his fleeing from the face of Absalom his son. Yahweh, how have my distresses multiplied! Many are rising up against me."
"Many are saying of my soul, `There is no salvation for him in God.' Selah."
"And Thou, O Yahweh, `art' a shield for me, My honour, and lifter up of my head."
"My voice  unto Yahweh: I call: And He answereth me from his holy hill, Selah."
"I -- I have lain down, and I sleep, I have waked, for Yahweh sustaineth me."
"I am not afraid of myriads of people, That round about they have set against me."
"Rise, O Yahweh! save me, my God. Because Thou hast smitten All mine enemies `on' the cheek. The teeth of the wicked Thou hast broken."
Of Yahweh  this salvation; On Thy people  Thy blessing! Selah.
