"In the going out of Israel from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a strange people,"
"Judah became His sanctuary, Israel his dominion."
"The sea hath seen, and fleeth, The Jordan turneth backward."
"The mountains have skipped as rams, Heights as sons of a flock."
"What -- to thee, O sea, that thou fleest? O Jordan, thou turnest back!"
"O mountains, ye skip as rams! O heights, as sons of a flock!"
"From before the Lord be afraid, O earth, From before the God of Jacob,"
"He is turning the rock to a pool of waters, The flint to a fountain of waters!"
