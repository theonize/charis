"Yahweh hath reigned, peoples tremble, The Inhabitant of the cherubs, the earth shaketh."
"Yahweh in Zion  great, And high He  over all the peoples."
"They praise Thy name, `Great, and fearful, holy `it' is.'"
"And the strength of the king Hath loved judgment, Thou -- Thou hast established uprightness; Judgment and righteousness in Jacob, Thou -- Thou hast done."
"Exalt ye Yahweh our God, And bow yourselves at His footstool, holy  He."
"Moses and Aaron among His priests, And Samuel among those proclaiming His name. They are calling unto Yahweh, And He doth answer them."
"In a pillar of cloud He speaketh unto them, They have kept His testimonies, And the statute He hath given to them."
"O Yahweh, our God, Thou hast afflicted them, A God forgiving Thou hast been to them, And taking vengeance on their actions."
"Exalt ye Yahweh our God, And bow yourselves at His holy hill, For holy  Yahweh our God!"
