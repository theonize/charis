"By David. Unto Thee, O Yahweh, I call, My rock, be not silent to me! Lest Thou be silent to me, And I have been compared With those going down to the pit."
"Hear the voice of my supplications, In my crying unto Thee, In my lifting up my hands toward thy holy oracle."
"Draw me not with the wicked, And with workers of iniquity, Speaking peace with their neighbours, And evil in their heart."
"Give to them according to their acting, And according to the evil of their doings. According to the work of their hands give to them. Return their deed to them."
"For they attend not to the doing of Yahweh, And unto the work of His hands. He throweth them down, And doth not build them up."
"Blessed  Yahweh, For He hath heard the voice of my supplications."
"Yahweh  my strength, and my shield, In Him my heart trusted, and I have been helped. And my heart exulteth, And with my song I thank Him."
"Yahweh  strength to him, Yea, the strength of the salvation of His anointed  He."
"Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance, And feed them, and carry them to the age!"
