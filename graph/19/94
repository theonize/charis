"God of vengeance -- Yahweh! God of vengeance, shine forth."
"Be lifted up, O Judge of the earth, Send back a recompence on the proud."
"Till when `do' the wicked, O Yahweh? Till when do the wicked exult?"
"They utter -- they speak an old saw, All working iniquity do boast themselves."
"Thy people, O Yahweh, they bruise, And Thine inheritance they afflict."
"Widow and sojourner they slay, And fatherless ones they murder."
"And they say, `Yahweh doth not see, And the God of Jacob doth not consider.'"
"Consider, ye brutish among the people, And ye foolish, when do ye act wisely?"
He who planteth the ear doth He not hear? He who formeth the eye doth He not see?
"He who is instructing nations, Doth He not reprove? He who is teaching man knowledge  Yahweh."
"He knoweth the thoughts of man, that they `are' vanity."
"O the happiness of the man Whom Thou instructest, O Jah, And out of Thy law teachest him,"
"To give rest to him from days of evil, While a pit is digged for the wicked."
"For Yahweh leaveth not His people, And His inheritance forsaketh not."
"For to righteousness judgment turneth back, And after it all the upright of heart,"
Who riseth up for me with evil doers? Who stationeth himself for me with workers of iniquity?
"Unless Yahweh `were' a help to me, My soul had almost inhabited silence."
"If I have said, `My foot hath slipped,' Thy kindness, O Yahweh, supporteth me."
"In the abundance of my thoughts within me, Thy comforts delight my soul."
Is a throne of mischief joined `with' Thee? A framer of perverseness by statute?
"They decree against the soul of the righteous, And innocent blood declare wicked."
"And Yahweh is for a high place to me, And my God  for a rock -- my refuge,"
"And turneth back on them their iniquity, And in their wickedness cutteth them off; Yahweh our God doth cut them off!"
