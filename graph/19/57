"To the Overseer. -- `Destroy not.' -- A secret treasure of David, in his fleeing from the face of Saul into a cave. Favour me, O God, favour me, For in Thee is my soul trusting, And in the shadow of Thy wings I trust, Until the calamities pass over."
"I call to God Most High, To God `who' is perfecting for me."
"He sendeth from the heaven, and saveth me, He reproached -- who is panting after me. Selah. God sendeth forth His kindness and His truth."
"My soul  in the midst of lions, I lie down `among' flames -- sons of men, Their teeth `are' a spear and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword."
"Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, Above all the earth Thine honour."
"A net they have prepared for my steps, Bowed down hath my soul, They have digged before me a pit, They have fallen into its midst. Selah."
"Prepared is my heart, O God, Prepared is my heart, I sing and praise."
"Awake, mine honour, awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the morning dawn."
"I thank Thee among the peoples, O Lord, I praise Thee among the nations."
"For great unto the heavens  Thy kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth."
"Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God. Above all the earth Thine honour!"
