"To the Overseer with Stringed Instruments. -- A Psalm of David. In my calling answer Thou me, O God of my righteousness. In adversity Thou gavest enlargement to me; Favour me, and hear my prayer."
"Sons of men! till when  my glory for shame? Ye love a vain thing, ye seek a lie. Selah."
And know ye that Yahweh Hath separated a saintly one to Himself. Yahweh heareth in my calling to Him.
"`Tremble ye, and do not sin;' Say ye `thus' in your heart on your bed, And be ye silent. Selah."
"Sacrifice ye sacrifices of righteousness, And trust ye unto Yahweh."
"Many are saying, `Who doth show us good?' Lift on us the light of Thy face, O Yahweh,"
"Thou hast given joy in my heart, From the time their corn and their wine Have been multiplied."
"In peace together I lie down and sleep, For Thou, O Yahweh, alone, In confidence dost cause me to dwell!"
