"To the Overseer, by David. -- `To cause to remember.' O God, to deliver me, O Yahweh, for my help, haste."
"Let them be ashamed and confounded Who are seeking my soul, Let them be turned backward and blush Who are desiring my evil."
"Let them turn back because of their shame, Who are saying, `Aha, aha.'"
"Let all those seeking Thee joy and be glad in Thee, And let those loving Thy salvation Say continually, `God is magnified.'"
"And I `am' poor and needy, O God, haste to me, My help and my deliverer `art' Thou, O Yahweh, tarry Thou not!"
