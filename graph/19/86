"A Prayer of David. Incline, O Yahweh, Thine ear, Answer me, for I `am' poor and needy."
"Keep my soul, for I `am' pious, Save Thy servant -- who is trusting to Thee, O Thou, my God."
"Favour me, O Lord, for to Thee I call all the day."
"Rejoice the soul of Thy servant, For unto Thee, O Lord, my soul I lift up."
"For Thou, Lord, `art' good and forgiving. And abundant in kindness to all calling Thee."
"Hear, O Yahweh, my prayer, And attend to the voice of my supplications."
"In a day of my distress I call Thee, For Thou dost answer me."
"There is none like Thee among the gods, O Lord, And like Thy works there are none."
"All nations that Thou hast made Come and bow themselves before Thee, O Lord, And give honour to Thy name."
"For great `art' Thou, and doing wonders, Thou `art' God Thyself alone."
"Show me, O Yahweh, Thy way, I walk in Thy truth, My heart doth rejoice to fear Thy name."
"I confess Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, And I honour Thy name to the age."
"For Thy kindness  great toward me, And Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol."
"O God, the proud have risen up against me, And a company of the terrible sought my soul, And have not placed Thee before them,"
"And Thou, O Lord, `art' God, merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in kindness and truth."
"Look unto me, and favour me, Give Thy strength to Thy servant, And give salvation to a son of Thine handmaid."
"Do with me a sign for good, And those hating me see and are ashamed, For Thou, O Yahweh, hast helped me, Yea, Thou hast comforted me!"
