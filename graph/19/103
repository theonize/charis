"Merciful and gracious  Yahweh, Slow to anger, and abundant in mercy."
"Not for ever doth He strive, Nor to the age doth He watch."
"Not according to our sins hath He done to us, Nor according to our iniquities Hath He conferred benefits upon us."

As the distance of east from west He hath put far from us our transgressions.
"As a father hath mercy on sons, Yahweh hath mercy on those fearing Him."
"For He hath known our frame, Remembering that we `are' dust."
"Mortal man! as grass `are' his days, As a flower of the field so he flourisheth;"
"For a wind hath passed over it, and it is not, And its place doth not discern it any more."
"And the kindness of Yahweh `Is' from age even unto age on those fearing Him, And His righteousness to sons' sons,"
"To those keeping His covenant, And to those remembering His precepts to do them."
"Yahweh in the heavens Hath established His throne, And His kingdom over all hath ruled."
