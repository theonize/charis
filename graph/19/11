"To the Overseer. -- By David. In Yahweh I trusted, how say ye to my soul, `They moved `to' Thy mountain for the bird?"
"For lo, the wicked tread a bow, They have prepared their arrow on the string, To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart."
"When the foundations are destroyed, The righteous -- what hath he done?"
`Yahweh  in his holy temple: Yahweh -- in the heavens  His throne. His eyes see -- His eyelids try the sons of men.
"Yahweh the righteous doth try. And the wicked and the lover of violence, Hath His soul hated,"
"He poureth on the wicked snares, fire, and brimstone, And a horrible wind  the portion of their cup."
"For righteous  Yahweh, Righteousness He hath loved, The upright doth His countenance see!'"
