"A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, a habitation Thou -- Thou hast been, To us -- in generation and generation,"
"Before mountains were brought forth, And Thou dost form the earth and the world, Even from age unto age Thou `art' God."
"Thou turnest man unto a bruised thing, And sayest, Turn back, ye sons of men."
"For a thousand years in Thine eyes `are' as yesterday, For it passeth on, yea, a watch by night."
"Thou hast inundated them, they are asleep, In the morning as grass he changeth."
"In the morning it flourisheth, and hath changed, At evening it is cut down, and hath withered."
"For we were consumed in Thine anger, And in Thy fury we have been troubled."
"Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee, Our hidden things to the illumination of Thy face,"
"For all our days pined away in Thy wrath, We consumed our years as a meditation."
"Days of our years, in them `are' seventy years, And if, by reason of might, eighty years, Yet  their enlargement labour and vanity, For it hath been cut off hastily, and we fly away."
Who knoweth the power of Thine anger? And according to Thy fear -- Thy wrath?
"To number our days aright let `us' know, And we bring the heart to wisdom."
"Turn back, O Yahweh, till when? And repent concerning Thy servants."
"Satisfy us at morn `with' Thy kindness, And we sing and rejoice all our days."
"Cause us to rejoice according to the days Wherein Thou hast afflicted us, The years we have seen evil."
"Let Thy work appear unto Thy servants, And Thine honour on their sons."
"And let the pleasantness of Yahweh our God be upon us, And the work of our hands establish on us, Yea, the work of our hands establish it!"
