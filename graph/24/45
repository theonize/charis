"The word that Jeremiah the prophet hath spoken unto Baruch son of Neriah, in his writing these words on a book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying:"
"`Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, concerning thee, O Baruch:"
"`Thou hast said, Wo to me, now, for Yahweh hath added sorrow to my pain, I have been wearied with my sighing, and rest I have not found."
"Thus dost thou say unto him: Thus said Yahweh: Lo, that which I have built I am throwing down, and that which I have planted I am plucking up, even the whole land itself."
"And thou -- thou seekest for thee great things -- do not seek, for lo, I am bringing in evil on all flesh -- an affirmation of Yahweh -- and I have given to thee thy life for a spoil, in all places whither thou goest.'"
