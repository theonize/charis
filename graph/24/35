"The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Yahweh, in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying:"
"`Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and thou hast spoken with them, and brought them into the house of Yahweh, unto one of the chambers, and caused them to drink wine.'"
"And I take Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and all the house of the Rechabites,"
"and bring them into the house of Yahweh, unto the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God, that  near to the chamber of the princes, that  above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold;"
"and I put before the sons of the house of the Rechabites goblets full of wine, and cups, and I say unto them, Drink ye wine."
"And they say, `We do not drink wine: for Jonadab son of Rechab, our father, charged us, saying, Ye do not drink wine, ye and your sons -- unto the age;"
"and a house ye do not build, and seed ye do not sow, and a vineyard ye do not plant, nor have ye any; for in tents do ye dwell all your days, that ye may live many days on the face of the ground whither ye are sojourning."
"`And we hearken to the voice of Jonadab son of Rechab, our father, to all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters;"
"nor to build houses for our dwelling; and vineyard, and field, and seed, we have none;"
"and we dwell in tents, and we hearken, and we do according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us;"
"and it cometh to pass, in the coming up of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon unto the land, that we say, Come, and we enter Jerusalem, because of the force of the Chaldeans, and because of the force of Aram -- and we dwell in Jerusalem.'"
"And there is a word of Yahweh unto Jeremiah, saying: `Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel:"
"`Go, and thou hast said to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Do ye not receive instruction? -- to hearken unto My words -- an affirmation of Yahweh."
"Performed have been the words of Jonadab son of Rechab, when he commanded his sons not to drink wine, and they have not drunk unto this day, for they have obeyed the command of their father; and I -- I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking, and ye have not hearkened unto Me."
"And I send unto you all My servants the prophets, rising early and sending, saying: Turn back, I pray you, each from his evil way, and amend your doings, yea, ye do not walk after other gods, to serve them, and dwell ye on the ground that I have given to you and to your fathers; and ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto Me."
"`Because the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab have performed the command of their father, that he commanded them, and this people have not hearkened unto Me,"
"therefore thus said Yahweh, God of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I am bringing in unto Judah, and unto all inhabitants of Jerusalem, all the evil that I have spoken against them, because I have spoken unto them, and they have not hearkened, yea, I call to them, and they have not answered.'"
"And to the house of the Rechabites said Jeremiah: `Thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, Because that ye have hearkened unto the command of Jonadab your father, and ye observe all his commands, and do according to all that he commanded you;"
"therefore, thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel, Of Jonadab son of Rechab one standing before me is not cut off all the days.'"
