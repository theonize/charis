"And there is a word of Yahweh unto me, saying:"
"Thou dost not take to thee a wife, Nor hast thou sons and daughters in this place."
"For thus said Yahweh, Of the sons and of the daughters who are born in this place, And of their mothers -- those bearing them, And of their fathers -- those begetting them in this land:"
"Of painful deaths they die, They are not lamented, nor are they buried, For dung on the face of the ground they are, And by sword and by famine are consumed, And their carcase hath been for food To the fowl of the heavens, And to the beast of the earth."
"For thus said Yahweh: Do not enter the house of a mourning-feast, Nor go to lament nor bemoan for them, For I have removed My peace from this people, An affirmation of Yahweh, The kindness and the mercies."
"And died have great and small in this land, They are not buried, and none lament for them, Nor doth any cut himself, nor become bald for them."
"Nor do they deal out to them for mourning, To comfort him concerning the dead, Nor cause them to drink a cup of consolations For his father and for his mother."
"A house of banqueting thou dost not enter, To sit with them, to eat and to drink,"
"For thus said Yahweh of Hosts, God of Israel: Lo, I am causing to cease from this place, Before your eyes, and in your days, The voice of joy, and the voice of rejoicing, The voice of bridegroom and voice of bride."
"And it hath come to pass when thou declarest to this people all these words, and they have said unto thee, `For what hath Yahweh spoken against us all this great evil? yea, what  our iniquity, and what our sin, that we have sinned against Yahweh our God?'"
"Then thou hast said unto them: Because that your fathers have forsaken Me, An affirmation of Yahweh, And go after other gods, and serve them, And they bow themselves to them, And Me have forsaken, and My law not kept,"
"Ye also have done evil above your fathers, And lo, ye are walking each after the stubbornness of his evil heart, So as not to hearken unto Me."
"And I have cast you from off this land, On to a land that ye have not known, Ye and your fathers, And ye have served there other gods by day and by night, Where I do not give to you grace."
"Therefore, lo, days are coming, An affirmation of Yahweh, And it is not said any more: `Yahweh liveth, who brought up The sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,'"
"But, `Yahweh liveth, who brought up The sons of Israel out of the land of the north, And out of all the lands whither He drove them,' And I have brought them back to their land, That I gave to their fathers."
"Lo, I am sending for many fishers, An affirmation of Yahweh, And they have fished them, And after this I send for many hunters, And they have hunted them from off every mountain, And from off every hill, and from holes of the rocks."
"For Mine eyes `are' upon all their ways, They have not been hidden from My face, Nor hath their iniquity been concealed from before Mine eyes."
"And I have recompensed a first -- A second time -- their iniquity and their sin, Because of their polluting My land, With the carcase of their detestable things, Yea, their abominable things have filled Mine inheritance."
"O Yahweh, my strength, and my fortress, And my refuge in a day of adversity, Unto Thee nations do come from the ends of earth, And say, Only falsehood did our fathers inherit, Vanity, and none among them is profitable."
"Doth man make for himself gods, And they -- no gods?"
"Therefore, lo, I am causing them to know at this time, I cause them to know My hand and My might, And they have known that My name  Yahweh!"
