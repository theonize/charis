"And he saith: I called, because of my distress, to Yahweh, And He doth answer me, From the belly of sheol I have cried, Thou hast heard my voice."
"When Thou dost cast me `into' the deep, Into the heart of the seas, Then the flood doth compass me, All Thy breakers and Thy billows have passed over me."
"And I -- I said: I have been cast out from before Thine eyes, (Yet I add to look unto Thy holy temple!)"
"Compassed me have waters unto the soul, The deep doth compass me, The weed is bound to my head."
"To the cuttings of mountains I have come down, The earth, her bars `are' behind me to the age. And Thou bringest up from the pit my life, O Yahweh my God."
"In the feebleness within me of my soul Yahweh I have remembered, And come in unto Thee doth my prayer, Unto Thy holy temple."
Those observing lying vanities their own mercy forsake.
"And I -- with a voice of thanksgiving -- I sacrifice to Thee, That which I have vowed I complete, Salvation  of Yahweh."
"And Yahweh saith to the fish, and it vomiteth out Jonah on the dry land."
