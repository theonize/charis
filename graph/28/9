"`Rejoice not, O Israel, be not joyful like the peoples, For thou hast gone a-whoring from thy God, Thou hast loved a gift near all floors of corn."
"Floor and wine-press do not delight them, And new wine doth fail in her,"
"They do not abide in the land of Yahweh, And turned back hath Ephraim `to' Egypt, And in Asshur an unclean thing they eat."
"They pour not out wine to Yahweh, Nor are they sweet to Him, Their sacrifices `are' as bread of mourners to them, All eating it are unclean: For their bread  for themselves, It doth not come into the house of Yahweh."
What do ye at the day appointed? And at the day of Yahweh's festival?
"For, lo, they have gone because of destruction, Egypt gathereth them, Moph burieth them, The desirable things of their silver, Nettles possess them -- a thorn  in their tents."
"Come in have the days of inspection, Come in have the days of recompence, Israel doth know! a fool  the prophet, Mad  the man of the Spirit, Because of the abundance of thine iniquity, And great  the hatred."
"Ephraim is looking `away' from My God, The prophet! a snare of a fowler  over all his ways, Hatred  in the house of his God."
"They have gone deep -- have done corruptly, As `in' the days of Gibeah, He doth remember their iniquity, He doth inspect their sins."
"As grapes in a wilderness I found Israel, As the first-fruit in a fig-tree, BRA$'+H, I have seen your fathers, They -- they have gone in `to' Baal-Peor, And are separated to a shameful thing, And are become abominable like their love."
"Ephraim  as a fowl, Fly away doth their honour, without birth, And without womb, and without conception."
"For though they nourish their sons, I have made them childless -- without man, Surely also, wo to them, when I turn aside from them."
"Ephraim! when I have looked to the rock, Is planted in comeliness, And Ephraim  to bring out unto a slayer his sons."
"Give to them, Yahweh -- what dost Thou give? Give to them miscarrying womb, and dry breasts."
"All their evil  in Gilgal, Surely there I have hated them, Because of the evil of their doings, Out of My house I do drive them, I add not to love them, all their heads `are' apostates."
"Ephraim hath been smitten, Their root hath dried up, fruit they yield not, Yea, though they bring forth, I have put to death the desired of their womb."
"Reject them doth my God, Because they have not hearkened to Him, And they are wanderers among nations!"
