"And Yahweh speaketh unto Moses, saying,"
"`Command the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, My offering, My bread for My fire-offerings, My sweet fragrance, ye take heed to bring near to Me in its appointed season."
"`And thou hast said to them, This  the fire-offering which ye bring near to Yahweh: two lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones, daily, a continual burnt-offering;"
"the one lamb thou preparest in the morning, and the second lamb thou preparest between the evenings;"
"and a tenth of the ephah of flour for a present, mixed with beaten oil, a fourth of the hin;"
"a continual burnt-offering, which was made in mount Sinai, for sweet fragrance, a fire-offering to Yahweh;"
"and its libation, a fourth of the hin for the one lamb; in the sanctuary cause thou a libation of strong drink to be poured out to Yahweh."
"`And the second lamb thou dost prepare between the evenings; as the present of the morning, and as its libation thou preparest -- a fire-offering, a sweet fragrance to Yahweh."
"`And on the sabbath-day, two lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones, and two-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, and its libation;"
"the burnt-offering of the sabbath in its sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering and its libation."
"`And in the beginnings of your months ye bring near a burnt-offering to Yahweh: two bullocks, sons of the herd, and one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones;"
"and three-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one bullock, and two-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one ram;"
"and a several tenth deal of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one lamb; a burnt-offering, a sweet fragrance, a fire-offering to Yahweh;"
"and their libations are a half of the hin to a bullock, and a third of the hin to a ram, and a fourth of the hin to a lamb, of wine; this  the burnt-offering of every month for the months of the year;"
"and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering to Yahweh; besides the continual burnt-offering it is prepared, and its libation."
"`And in the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month,  the passover to Yahweh;"
"and in the fifteenth day of this month  a festival, seven days unleavened food is eaten;"
"in the first day  an holy convocation, ye do no servile work,"
"and ye have brought near a fire-offering, a burnt-offering to Yahweh: two bullocks, sons of the herd, and one ram, and seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones they are for you;"
"and their present, flour mixed with oil, three-tenth deals for a bullock, and two-tenth deals for a ram ye do prepare;"
"a several tenth deal thou preparest for the one lamb, for the seven lambs,"
"and one goat, a sin-offering, to make atonement for you."
"`Apart from the burnt-offering of the morning, which  for the continual burnt-offering, ye prepare these;"
"according to these ye prepare daily, seven days, bread of a fire-offering, a sweet fragrance, to Yahweh; besides the continual burnt-offering it is prepared, and its libation;"
"and on the seventh day a holy convocation ye have, ye do no servile work."
"`And in the day of the first-fruits, in your bringing near a new present to Yahweh, in your weeks, a holy convocation ye have; ye do no servile work;"
"and ye have brought near a burnt-offering for sweet fragrance to Yahweh: two bullocks, sons of the herd, one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year,"
"and their present, flour mixed with oil, three-tenth deals to the one bullock, two-tenth deals to the one ram,"
"a several tenth deal to the one lamb, for the seven lambs;"
one kid of the goats to make atonement for you;
apart from the continual burnt-offering and its present ye prepare `them' (perfect ones they are for you) and their libations.
