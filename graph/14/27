"A son of twenty and five years  Jotham in his reigning, and sixteen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother  Jerushah daughter of Zadok."
"And he doth that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that Uzziah his father did; only, he hath not come in unto the temple of Yahweh; and again are the people doing corruptly."
"He hath built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and in the wall of Ophel he hath built abundantly;"
"and cities he hath built in the hill-country of Judah, and in the forests he hath built palaces and towers."
"And he hath fought with the king of the sons of Ammon, and prevaileth over them, and the sons of Ammon give to him in that year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cors of wheat, and of barley ten thousand; this have the sons of Ammon returned to him both in the second year, and in the third."
"And Jotham doth strengthen himself, for he hath prepared his ways before Yahweh his God."
"And the rest of the matters of Jotham, and all his battles, and his ways, lo, they are written on the book of the kings of Israel and Judah."
"A son of twenty and five years was he in his reigning, and sixteen years he hath reigned in Jerusalem;"
"and Jotham lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in the city of David, and reign doth Ahaz his son in his stead."
