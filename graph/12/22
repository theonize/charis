"A son of eight years  Josiah in his reigning, and thirty and one years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother  Jedidah daughter of Adaiah of Boskath,"
"and he doth that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walketh in all the way of David his father, and hath not turned aside -- right or left."
"And it cometh to pass, in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, the king hath sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Yahweh, saying,"
"`Go up unto Hilkiah the high priest, and he doth complete the silver that is brought into the house of Yahweh, that the keepers of the threshold have gathered from the people,"
"and they give it into the hand of the doers of the work, the overseers, in the house of Yahweh, and they give it to the doers of the work that  in the house of Yahweh, to strengthen the breach of the house,"
"to artificers, and to builders, and `to repairers of' the wall, and to buy wood and hewn stones to strengthen the house;"
"only, the silver that is given into their hand is not reckoned with them, for in faithfulness they are dealing."
"And Hilkiah the high priest saith unto Shaphan the scribe, `A book of the law I have found in the house of Yahweh;' and Hilkiah giveth the book unto Shaphan, and he readeth it."
"And Shaphan the scribe cometh in unto the king, and bringeth the king back word, and saith, `Thy servants have poured out the silver that hath been found in the house, and give it into the hand of the doers of the work, the inspectors, in the house of Yahweh.'"
"And Shaphan the scribe declareth to the king, saying, `A book hath Hilkiah the priest given to me;' and Shaphan readeth it before the king."
"And it cometh to pass, at the king's hearing the words of the book of the law, that he rendeth his garments,"
"and the king commandeth Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam son of Shaphan, and Achbor son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah servant of the king, saying,"
"`Go, seek Yahweh for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found, for great  the fury of Yahweh that is kindled against us, because that our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according to all that is written for us.'"
"And Hilkiah the priest goeth, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, unto Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum, son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the garments, and she is dwelling in Jerusalem in the second, and they speak unto her."
"And she saith unto them, `Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, Say to the man who hath sent you unto me:"
"Thus said Yahweh, Lo, I am bringing in evil unto this place and on its inhabitants, all the words of the book that the king of Judah hath read,"
"because that they have forsaken Me, and make perfume to other gods, so as to provoke Me to anger with every work of their hands, and My wrath hath been kindled against this place, and it is not quenched."
"`And unto the king of Judah, who is sending you to seek Yahweh, thus do ye say unto him, Thus said Yahweh, God of Israel, The words that thou hast heard --"
"because thy heart  tender, and thou art humbled because of Yahweh, in thy hearing that which I have spoken against this place, and against its inhabitants, to be for a desolation, and for a reviling, and dost rend thy garments, and weep before Me -- I also have heard -- the affirmation of Yahweh --"
"therefore, lo, I am gathering thee unto thy fathers, and thou hast been gathered unto thy grave in peace, and thine eyes do not look on any of the evil that I am bringing in on this place;' and they bring the king back word."
