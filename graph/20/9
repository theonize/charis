"Wisdom hath builded her house, She hath hewn out her pillars -- seven."
"She hath slaughtered her slaughter, She hath mingled her wine, Yea, she hath arranged her table."
"She hath sent forth her damsels, She crieth on the tops of the high places of the city:"
"`Who  simple? let him turn aside hither.' Whoso lacketh heart: she hath said to him,"
"`Come, eat of my bread, And drink of the wine I have mingled."
"Forsake ye, the simple, and live, And be happy in the way of understanding."
"The instructor of a scorner Is receiving for it -- shame, And a reprover of the wicked -- his blemish."
"Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee, Give reproof to the wise, and he loveth thee."
"Give to the wise, and he is wiser still, Make known to the righteous, And he increaseth learning."
"The commencement of wisdom  the fear of Yahweh, And a knowledge of the Holy Ones  understanding."
"For by me do thy days multiply, And added to thee are years of life."
"If thou hast been wise, thou hast been wise for thyself, And thou hast scorned -- thyself bearest `it'."
"A foolish woman  noisy, Simple, and hath not known what."
"And she hath sat at the opening of her house, On a throne -- the high places of the city,"
"To call to those passing by the way, Who are going straight `on' their paths."
"`Who  simple? let him turn aside hither.' And whoso lacketh heart -- she said to him,"
"`Stolen waters are sweet, And hidden bread is pleasant.'"
"And he hath not known that Rephaim `are' there, In deep places of Sheol her invited ones!"
