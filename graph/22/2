"As a lily among the thorns,"
So  my friend among the daughters!
"As a citron among trees of the forest, So  my beloved among the sons, In his shade I delighted, and sat down, And his fruit  sweet to my palate."
"He hath brought me in unto a house of wine, And his banner over me  love,"
"Sustain me with grape-cakes, Support me with citrons, for I `am' sick with love."
"His left hand  under my head, And his right doth embrace me."
"I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes or by the hinds of the field, Stir not up nor wake the love till she please!"
"The voice of my beloved! lo, this -- he is coming, Leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills."
"My beloved  like to a roe, Or to a young one of the harts. Lo, this -- he is standing behind our wall, Looking from the windows, Blooming from the lattice."
"My beloved hath answered and said to me, `Rise up, my friend, my fair one, and come away,"
"For lo, the winter hath passed by, The rain hath passed away -- it hath gone."
"The flowers have appeared in the earth, The time of the singing hath come, And the voice of the turtle was heard in our land,"
"The fig-tree hath ripened her green figs, And the sweet-smelling vines have given forth fragrance, Rise, come, my friend, my fair one, yea, come away."
"My dove, in clefts of the rock, In a secret place of the ascent, Cause me to see thine appearance, Cause me to hear thy voice, For thy voice  sweet, and thy appearance comely."
"Seize ye for us foxes, Little foxes -- destroyers of vineyards, Even our sweet-smelling vineyards."
"My beloved  mine, and I `am' his, Who is delighting among the lilies,"
"Till the day doth break forth, And the shadows have fled away, Turn, be like, my beloved, To a roe, or to a young one of the harts, On the mountains of separation!"
